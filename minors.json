Emily Thompson explains that in the Victorian period the 'sounds that so bothered Carlyle and Goethe were almost identical to those that had been identified by the Buddha centuries earlier: organic sounds created by humans and animals at work and at play' (Soundscape 116). It is not until the early twentieth century, according to Thompson, that machine-generated noises started to impinge upon the everyday lives of people. Called the 'Age of Noise,' the turn of twentieth century was filled with the sounds of auditory technologies (the microphone, radio, telephone, and phonograph), public transportation (the elevated train and subway), World War I, construction, factories, steam locomotives, industrial whistles and bells, machine shops, cash registers, washing machines, sewing machines, vacuum cleaners, typewriters, printing machines, automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles. This course explores how modernist writers represented this soundscape. How did they make their narratives sound out? How did the changing soundscape influence and shape their representations of sound and listening?"

This course should not be interpreted to be a pure programming language course. Rather, the programming language serves to illustrate, via practical examples, the concepts learnt in the course. As a student of this course, you will learn essential object-oriented concepts such as encapsulation, the separation of design from implementation; the use of inheritance and polymorphism. You will discover how to describe these concepts using appropriate UML diagrams. Finally, you will also learn good design principles for reuse, and to realise these principles using object-oriented programming languages such as Java and/or C++."

How do posthuman thoughts and representations lead us beyond anthropocentrism, and show us a world characterised by the increasingly blurred boundaries between humans, nonhuman animals and machines, particularly in an age of many environmental challenges? How do cultural imaginations of Chinese supernatural beings (e.g. monsters, spirits and vampires from Chinese folk legends) expand the western-centric theoretical discussion in posthumanism?

We will end the course with contemporary engagements with the idea of revolution by looking at some realist literature from Taiwan, documentary films from Hong Kong, and the suppressed articulations of dissent in mainland China. The themes of art and revolution provide a specific perspective to revisit modern Chinese literary history. They highlight the political urgencies behind the renovation of national culture in the beginning of the twentieth century, and reveal how such imperatives continued to shape the changing contour of Chinese literature and culture throughout this long century. The focus on art and revolution also allow us to look beyond revolution in its most straightforward political sense, and attend to the revolution of gender norms and cultural forms that were equally important in modern Chinese history. We will pay attention to this multifaceted idea of revolutionary in our textual analyses of literary and artistic works. The texts covered in this course ranges from literature, film, documentary, the visual arts, as well as theoretical and discursive documents. We will also address different genres of literature such as fiction, drama, and poetry."

    "module_description": "The object-oriented paradigm to the design of software is one major successful approach to address complexity and maintainability issues in software systems. We want students to establish an object-oriented mindset and to gain valuable insights into how software can be developed using the object-oriented approach. This course should not be interpreted to be a pure programming language course. Rather, the programming language serves to illustrate, via practical examples, the concepts learnt in the course. As a student of this course, you will learn essential object-oriented concepts such as encapsulation, the separation of design from implementation; the use of inheritance and polymorphism. You will discover how to describe these concepts using appropriate UML diagrams. Finally, you will also learn good design principles for reuse, and to realise these principles using object-oriented programming languages such as Java and/or C++."

Once a cultural backwater, the intensive export of South Korean products has changed the flow of the transnational circulation of popular media and culture not just East and Southeast Asia, but the larger world. Making up for its geo-political marginality is its newfound soft power status when countless households from Japan to Latin America are watching its television dramas and where teenagers from Singapore to Canada line up for Kpop auditions to be the next Korean popular music sensation. Accompanying the Korean Wave, or Hallyu are the heightened popular and scholarly discussions of the attributes of this phenomenon. A combination factors have been put forward to explain the rise of the Korean Wave including the release in creative energies arising from political liberalization in the 1990s, technological advancement particular in the era of the digital and social media, and significant investment and sophisticated marketing. In this respect, as a course, the Korean Wave will offer a potentially multidisciplinary engagement with students, many who are already avid fans of Hallyu products and icons.",

Finally, this course delves into the wide range of empirical study in a variety of disciplines regarding human-machine communication. Through these three lenses of theory, application, and research, students will leave the course able to understand the optimal uses (and potential pitfalls) of supplementing or replacing human communicators with machines. Through the theory and research components, this course is especially geared towards preparing students for the technologies of the future such as social robots and artificially intelligent agents. Regardless of the major track taken in the WKWSCI, it is undeniable that the advance of automation will be a defining issue throughout the 21st Century - Automation and Macro-Communication prepares WKWSCI students to be future, professional, research, and thought leaders in a future world where people live and work with machines.",

As you may already know, a working knowledge of marketing is beneficial wherever your career takes you. We will discuss basic principles of marketing. However, the focus is on its application and how this understanding could potentially enhance your future performance in your chosen field. A hands-on approach is expected and activities have been incorporated to encourage observation and enhance analytical ability. The course will require you to analyse businesses, evaluate alternatives, collaborate with team members, lead discussions, present your analysis and propose recommendations on selected organisations. The course will begin by discussing sustainable marketing in the global context. We continue with marketing strategy and customer value. This requires an understanding of the business environment and buyer behaviour. We then focus on the 4 P?s, namely product, price, place and promotion.",

    "module_description": "Communication with the market is an important activity for many businesses and organizations. It is also relevant to us as consumers because we are exposed to hundreds of messages from marketers every day. The course is aimed at enabling students to learn in depth the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication (marcom) activities. The course provides students with relevant knowledge about how businesses interact or communicate with the market. In particular, because planning and executing marketing communication programs are typically the responsibilities of marketing executives, the course can help students to prepare for a job position that involves marketing communications. It can help them deepen their understanding of marketing - in particular, what marketing communications involve and how marketing communications enable an organisation to achieve its objectives. The course is designed to foster your logical thinking and creativity regarding marketing communications. Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts essential to your understanding of marketing communication (marcom) practices (e.g., how they work and their applicability). Learning these theories and concepts is also important because they facilitate you to choose and justify your choice and design of marcom activities. Instead of treating marcom as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities. The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing). The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and discusses how they can be integrated for achieving the marketer's objectives. While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances.",

    "module_description": "As a sports coach helps an athlete develop and excel at a sport, a health coach helps a person or team to excel at living healthy life to the full, taking the best. This course will equip you with foundations of health coaching - skills useful for life wherever it takes you - whether you will be the next CEO, a full-time dad or mom, an entrepreneur or a cool government employee. It comprises a series of modules covering highly engaging topics on health coaching with a focus on sleep as a superpower. This is the first course in a stackable learning series that would equip you ultimately as a super health coach. The course consists of 13 three-hour sessions (two sessions of 3 hours per week) comprising of blended and highly interactive learning activities, conducted in the first six weeks of Semester 1 AY2021-22. The last session will be an assessment session held in the sixth week. In addition, this same course will also be run in the last six weeks of Semester 1 AY2021-22, and an assessment session to be held in the sixth week. These sessions will cover the following seven themes: 1. Being cool! Being super-woman and -man (introduction to health coaching) 2. Who cares about sleep? Superpower. (sleep) 3. This is so tasty! (nutrition) 4. Sweat the good stuff (exercise) 5. Why? Why? It's driving me crazy! (mental wellbeing) 6. Is it gonna harm me? (addictions) 7. Relationships matter! (healthy relationships) The modules cover the topic of sleep, but also important areas that affect sleep such as nutrition, exercise, mental wellbeing, addictions, and healthy relationships. These modules will be offered in a `flipped classroom model' where students self-study materials and subsequently have discussions and practical interactive sessions. The students will practice coaching skills which will be assessed in a role-based assessment with simulated roles. The cutting-edge role of digital health supporting the coach and the person will be interwoven in every module. Finally, we Singaporeans are one of the most sleep deprived people. Some might even be proud about regularly not sleeping enough. However, this comes at a high price for wellbeing and health. Utilizing the superpower of sleep has a wide range of proven health benefits including a lower chance of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, and not least making one feel better! Recognizing that one can be cool whilst living healthy and shunning away from unhealthy lifestyle habits and applying early preventive measures to improve health is possible and is focus of this course. An important strategy to facilitate healthy lifestyle choices and promote health is through health coaching. Health coaching has been applied and shown to be effective in the prevention and management of chronic diseases and supporting lifestyle choices in healthy individuals. It is crucial to equip students with healthy lifestyle skills and knowledge and, specifically, on coaching techniques to create awareness about the importance of lifestyle choices. It will allow students to be equipped with essential skills to become health coaches and to take the role of health ambassadors later in their life. Moreover, health coaching can provide new career opportunities, with employment in healthcare expected to increase enormously in the coming years. This course will be the first in a series of courses on health coaching, with the current course having a focus on sleep. Sleep is crucial for health and wellbeing, and it is known that many students do not get enough sleep However, sleep deprivation is linked to lower cognitive and academic performance, lower productivity, obesity, depression, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, and numerous other health risk factors. Exercise, nutrition, and mental wellbeing all have an important influence on a healthy sleep pattern. A `stackable learning approach' is planned in which students will be able to `stack' certificates that will eventually lead to a professional diploma as health coach."

The learning environment has been espoused as the `third educator', a concept which is strongly rooted in early childhood education. Participants will gain insights into how the learning environments can provide stimulating and engaging activities that promote quality learning for the children across all learning domains. In order to be equipped with the essential knowledge and skills to design effective environments, they will learn how to consider the needs of diverse children (individual and group), the relevance of the learning contexts, the use of age-appropriate and open-ended resources, issues of safety (physical and psychological), and the interlocking roles of the teacher as the environmental designer and as the facilitator of the learning in the setting up of the environment. To highlight the importance of exploration and play-based learning, and authentic experiences for preschool or lower primary children, the employment of learning centres will be extensively explored as an important pedagogical approach for teachers in the preschool or lower primary specialization. A key idea here is that the learning environment can support children as the protagonists of their construction of knowledge and foster respectful relationships. The course will therefore provide participants with an understanding of the principles and roles of learning centers and how these can be thoughtfully integrated within the preschool or lower primary curriculum and class setups (indoor and outdoor). The course will have a strong practical orientation. There will be opportunities for participants to link theory to practice through hands-on activities and assignments. Where possible, field trips will also be organized to expose participants to actual environmental setups as part of their learning experiences.

Among other issues, the issues in monetary policy studied here include the welfare effects of an increasing stock of fiat money, the development of financial intermediaries in the presence of differences in the rates of return between illiquid capital and money, and the reasons for the observed correlation between the nominal money stock and real output. The issues in exchange-rate policy studied here include the implications of different international monetary systems, the determination of exchange rates in the presence of currency controls and the indeterminacy of exchange rates when people are free to hold currencies of their choice."

Following this, we will examine seminal texts by William Wordsworth and Jane Austen before embarking on a series of thematic lectures on the city, education and children's books, and the pleasures and pains of opium. In order to reflect the diversity of print culture between 1740 and 1820, this course explores a variety of primary source material. Literary works, such as poetry and fiction, will be examined alongside pedagogical theory and discourses on elocution and aesthetics. Throughout the course, we will consider our own experience as readers of eighteenth-century and Romantic texts in relation to reading practice during the period. How did rising literacy rates and innovations in textual production and circulation influence literary form, genre, and taste?"

The central context of the dramatic changes lie in changes in modernization policy in Singapore - in the 1970s, from a 'pragmatic' and culturally philistine modernization that sought to homogenize/standardize culture and the cityscape in the name of economic development, to a 1990s- present modernization that (in contrast) desires Singapore to be a more hip 'global city for the arts' (a 1992 government-policy phrase). The changing contexts are as important as the texts to be examined. Why was the Singapore state not interested in what can be called 'high culture' or 'serious art' in the 1960s & 1970s? The emphasis then appeared to be on culture conceived of as 'racial' and ethnic culture - and such ethnic-cultural identities are effectively transformed by the urban change and state-led social engineering. What sort of literary and other cultural responses were there in relation to the state's policies on culture and racial management in the 1980s? What happened in the state's thinking on culture in the 1990s that led a (supposed move away from a philistinism) to a desire to invest in the arts? How did creative-cultural producers relate to these unexpected changes? Such will be the questions that this module will address."

Contemporary British writers are deeply aware of international intellectual and artistic developments and the sheer variety of narrative approaches testify to the major contribution made by recent writers to the contemporary novel. Thus, it is possible to consider their work as representative of contemporary European society, while being conscious of profound threads of connection with the idea of the contemporary beyond the borders of Britain."

The nature, causes, and meaning of states of health and sickness is determined not only by physical symptoms but influenced by class, gender, and race, and is perceived differently by patients, practitioners, and policy-makers. Twentieth-century British authors such as Ian McEwan, A.S. Byatt, Ali Smith, James Kelman, David Lodge, and Will Self offer a cultural history of the present that is united by a particular concern with the myths and metaphors that contribute to our under-standing of health and sickness. Accordingly Literature and Medicine guides students through a series of literary texts that engage with contemporary issues of health and sickness and signal the inadequacy of any understanding of health that is not culturally, historically, and geographically situated. Literature and Medicine uncovers the ways in which twentieth-century British authors urge us to reclaim the narrative of the individual sick person and reconsider what it means to be healthy and what it means to be sick in the twenty-first century. Sociological readings on the history and philosophy of medicine that signal the inadequa-cy of any understanding of health that is not culturally, historically and geographically sit-uated. Novels concerned with the myths and metaphors that contribute to our understanding of health and sickness. Material from the emergent field of the medical humanities including anthropology and cultural studies, literature and applied linguistics, performing arts, visual art, and creative practices with a focus on healing and recovery. Supplementary material on approaches to delivering humanities into healthcare and the requirement for practice based evidence."

Encoun- ters with the uncarmy/unheimlich (unhomely) and the abject in these texts unveil deep- seated anxieties regarding race, gender, class, and power, and these are collated with the way that the gothic reconfigures or destabilizes identity, especially as it relates to larger notions of nationhood, history, and belonging. Texts may include Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger (2008), Raja Rao's Kanthapura (1938/1970), Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea, and Beth Yahp's The Crocodile Sea."

In each case study, we will (1) evaluate whether the literary work meets our or other definitions of virtual reality, (2) analyse how the work generates its particular immersive effects, and (3) discuss the significance of immersive experience both to the work's specific aims and contexts, and to our modern understandings of virtuality."

In studying the historical experience of developing countries (in Africa, Latin America and Asia), this subject views development and social change through the lens of political, economic and cultural processes, recognizing that outcomes of 'development' often hinge on competing ideas, conflicting interests, and power asymmetries.

Cities are growing in size and in presence! Literature about cities and urbanism proliferates as new fads of urbanism ebb and flow. With the deluge of information about the woes and potentialities of cities for human futures, this course aims to take a reflective stance and ask as Lewis Mumford once did, 'What is a City?' with the goal to gain clarity about the concept, purpose and the nuts and bolts of a city as a human environment. This course draws upon selected readings in classic and modern philosophy about what a good city is. Even though these philosophical readings discussed cities in the classical and early modern times, they touched upon many dimensions and challenging issues of contemporary cities including size, class, inequality, diversity, justice and their relationship with the urban built environment. These topics are intended to form the content of the course for the subsequent weeks. Whenever available and appropriate, policy reports from international organizations like the United Nations will be included in the topical discussion throughout the semester to make explicit the nexus between theory and practice that lies at the crux of most urban research. The course content is deliberately multi-disciplinary, reflecting the rich and vast interest in the planning and development of cities. This course is for students who are keen to further engage in a critical inquiry of cities and discussing about what a good city is, beyond the basic content offered in HU1002: Introduction to Urban Planning and HU2002: Urban Life and Urban Planning. The course is crafted with the aim to allow students to co-produce and co-own the course content that they find valuable in informing their interests about the subject matter, and their graduation research projects."

This will also show that development is not disembodied but made up of and affects different people in very different ways.

The course introduces students to the history of archaeology defined by its focus on material culture, and how its development intersects with history, especially in the study of past cultures, societies and technologies of periods when historical documentation was also available. The course begins with a diachronic survey of the relations between history and archaeology before narrowing its focus to the specific development of historical archaeology in North America and its impact on other parts of the world, especially Asia. By examining case studies, images, and readings, the course helps students to acquire elementary skills to interpret the information presented in the course.

We will examine their intellectual history, evolving practices, their practitioners and patients and its impact on modern society, drawing on history, anthropology, and health research. While the two traditions have generally been studied in silos, this course places them in juxtaposition, enabling us to interrogate connections, interactions, and contestations across traditions. The course moves forward through thematic seminars, taught in turn by the instructors. Designed to encourage comparisons, we will interrogate how each tradition is defined, the characteristics and influences shaping practice of medicine, the connections between traditional medicine and the natural world, the emergence of hybrid practices such as Peranakan, and how traditional medicine supports, complements, and contests biomedicine in the modern state. This course is targeted for those who are keen to explore medicine beyond the scientific tradition and explore approaches that deprivilege biomedicine and institutions such as hospitals to delve into a past where healthcare was less institutionalized and regulated. It will be of value to humanities students who may be contemplating career paths in the health service (particularly in the burgeoning fields of alternative medicine) and to medical students who would like to integrate biomedical and traditional approaches to healing."

In addition, the course will analyze the effect that the turn of events in the area had on global and international developments. To those ends, the course will pay particular attention to the multidimensional attempts by external powers to expand their influence in Southeast Asia as well as the ways that peoples within the area furthered their personal and national ends by exploiting, adapting to, and resisting the Cold War powers` involvement in their societies. By studying developments within twentieth century Southeast Asia from global, international, transnational, and national perspectives, therefore, we will discover that inasmuch as external forces had shaped the subregion, Southeast Asians had also made significant impacts on the course of global and international history."

    "Prerequisite:": "HH1001",
    "module_description": "The cultures of South Asia are among the most fetishized in the Western world, and few Indian concepts lend themselves to fetishization better than tantra. In popular culture, tantra is associated not only with images of transgressive sexuality, but also antinomian violence and a glamorization of death. When Western scholars in colonial India discovered tantra, they were horrified to find ritual manuals detailing how one may consume the flesh of corpses, channel the goddesses of the cremation ground, and recite spells to butcher one's enemies. This course begins with a critique of colonial misconceptions and then proceeds to examine tantra in its original South Asian contexts. The term tantra, which translates roughly to 'technology,' or 'technique,' rose to prominence in medieval South Asian culture during a moment of radical historical transformation (300?1200CE). In contrast to the modern image of the state-an orderly, unified, and bureaucratized entity, in which the work ethic of the nuclear family facilitates a highly regulated economy-medieval South Asia was essentially an anarchic space. These tantras emerged in the world of medieval South Asia as a set of techniques for coping with, and accruing power within, a political and social reality perceived to be dystopian, chaotic, and slouching toward decay. But, it was precisely because political unification was elusive that the Indian Subcontinent was fertile ground for radical innovation. In this course, we will examine the complex ecosystem of political, economic, religious, aesthetic, and philosophical institutions of tantric South Asia that challenged-and even reversed-classical Indian gender, familial, caste, religious, and ritual norms. The first section of the course discusses the cultural and literary building blocks of tantra articulated in archaic and classical Indian culture (1000BCE-300CE), including ritual literature, court poetry, and treatises on politics, erotic desire, and warfare. We will then examine the tantric culture of reversals of classical Indian norms during the medieval period (300-1200CE): the Tantric Age. Finally, we will consider the enduring legacies of tantra in South Asian culture in the last section of the course, Tantric Afterlives (1200CE-present)."

The course will provide the students with a general and accurate overview of the above-mentioned topics, associating notions of Language Documentation and Language Description with elements of Anthropological Linguistics, Philology, and Comparative Literature. The course examines the epistemological issue of orality, culture, and literacy both from the point of view of basic original and theoretical principles established by the best scholars in this discipline (from Milman Parry, to Albert Lord, to Eric Havelock, to Marcel Jousse, to John Foley, to Ruth Finnegan, to Edgard Sienaert), and from the point of view of the direct analysis of examples of oral `unwritten texts? and oral strategies in handing down the traditional knowledge. The teaching activity will be also substantiated by the application of general principles of Theoretical Linguistics and Comparative Literature. Particular attention will be given to the analysis of a number of methodological `milestones? in the study on orality, culture, and literacy, in particular to The Anthropology of Gesture by Marcel Jousse and to works by Milman Parry, Eric Havelock, Albert Lord, and Ruth Finnegan. The course will introduce, therefore, the study of orality, language, and literature in a historical and theoretical way, not only analyzing the related general issues, but also dealing with the direct application of basic principles in reading and interpreting `unwritten texts? of oral traditions from all over the world."

Furthermore the course focuses on the expansion of vocabulary through the usage of more complex texts (reading and listening), which will enable a more complex and diverse understanding and use of the language in a variety of daily situations and discussions. Although the course develops all four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) a special emphasis is placed on the active language production, especially the oral aspect. Audio-visual materials are used extensively and German is used almost exclusively as the language of instruction in the classroom. This course is equivalent to Level A2.2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and it prepares students to sit for the official external examination Start Deutsch 2 (SD2). The examination is the official accreditation of the degree of fluency of the German Language, issued and recognized by the German government and conducted at the Goethe Institut Singapur."

    "module_description": "This course aims to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of game theory and mechanism design. Game theory, besides being of fundamental mathematical interest, is a main tool to model economic and strategic situations and then study the behavior of rational agents in such situations. Mechanism design is the study of how to design games (such as auctions) so that agents have incentive to act in a desirable way, e.g. by telling the truth. This course will improve your ability to model and analyze economics situations in a mathematical way. We will study the way rational agents will play games, based on their assumptions about the rationality of other agents. We will learn about the concept of Nash equilibria, which are solutions to games that no rational agent has an incentive to deviate from, and learn how to compute these. In the second part of the course we turn to the problem of social choice, namely choosing from a set of alternatives, given the preferences of a set of players. We will see that many desirable properties of social choice functions cannot be satisfied, and then turn to ways to deal with this issue. The first way is to introduce payments and money-valued preferences, which leads to auction theory and related topics. Here students will learn how to design auctions and other economic mechanisms so that players have no incentive to lie, and to learn how to compute expected revenues. Secondly, we will consider mechanisms that do not allow payments, and study the ways manipulations by the players can be limited in this case. In the second part of the course students will learn how to design economic mechanisms that have certain properties (if possible), and how to judge economic mechanisms, as well as to apply Bayesian reasoning to compute expected outcomes. The course is aimed at 3rd and 4th year students interested in economics, mathematical modelling, and applied math in general."

Furthermore the course focuses on the expansion of vocabulary through the usage of more complex texts (reading and listening), which will enable a more complex and diverse understanding and use of the language in a variety of daily situations and discussions. Although the course develops all four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) a special emphasis is placed on the active language production, especially the oral aspect. Audio-visual materials are used extensively and German is used almost exclusively as the language of instruction in the classroom. This course is equivalent to Level A2.2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and it prepares students to sit for the official external examination Start Deutsch 2 (SD2). The examination is the official accreditation of the degree of fluency of the German Language, issued and recognized by the German government and conducted at the Goethe Institut Singapur."

It is also relevant to us as consumers because we are exposed to hundreds of messages from marketers every day. The course is aimed at enabling students to learn in depth the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication (marcom) activities. The course provides students with relevant knowledge about how businesses interact or communicate with the market. In particular, because planning and executing marketing communication programs are typically the responsibilities of marketing executives, the course can help students to prepare for a job position that involves marketing communications. It can help them deepen their understanding of marketing - in particular, what marketing communications involve and how marketing communications enable an organisation to achieve its objectives. The course is designed to foster your logical thinking and creativity regarding marketing communications. Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts essential to your understanding of marketing communication (marcom) practices (e.g., how they work and their applicability). Learning these theories and concepts is also important because they facilitate you to choose and justify your choice and design of marcom activities. Instead of treating marcom as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities. The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing). The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and discusses how they can be integrated for achieving the marketer's objectives. While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances.",

Gaining an understanding of the exposure triangle and how technical choices affect the aesthetic of an image: depth of field, motion blur, grain, and lens distortion. The Digital Workflow: Digital technology has become a powerful tool for photographers. Increased flexibility and control of the image-making process, has allowed for greater expressive freedom. The first half of this course introduces you to the digital photographer?s workflow. Through demonstration, instruction and in-class assignments, you will gain an understanding of essential skills, from the capturing of images, to basic photo editing, and to creating archival quality photographic prints. You will have access to Nikon DSLR cameras; software such as Photoshop and Adobe Bridge; and Epson Inkjet printers. What Makes a Good Photograph? An investigation into the elements of a good photograph. Exploring within a single image, the basic concepts of framing, composition, lighting, colour and subject engagement. Through analysis of each other?s prints, you will learn about the importance of colour management and its effect on tonality and colour characteristics. Differences and similarities between Straight Photography and Conceptual Photography will be discussed. Developing a Photographic Series: An in-depth exploration of strategies to develop a photographic series. Different artists and genres of photography will be introduced to help you articulate your own photographic interests. Project development will be guided along through the stages of researching references, planning, execution and review. You will also learn to apply basic concepts of curation with the editing, selection and presentation of images. The Role of the Photographer: Through analysis and discussions of a variety of images, you will be introduced to the semiotics of photography and the role of the photographer in its creation. The photographer as director/art director takes on the responsibility of meaning-making within the frame. Awareness will be brought to the ideas of the preconditioned gaze and the definition of the self in opposition to the other. This will translate to working with subjects and how best to engage and represent them in a photograph. Photography in the Digital Age of Social Media: Digital technology has made the photographic image more ubiquitous than ever. Lectures and discussions will touch upon photographic history and theory, as we try to locate the position of photography as an art form in the age of social media and the proliferation of the everyday image. Attempts will be made as a class to define distinguishing or overlapping traits between fine art and vernacular photography. Class Assignments: - Three creative projects of increasing difficulty help guide you along the process of developing a conceptual photography series. These projects are developed through lectures, tutorials, and instructor and peer feedback sessions. During guided group critiques of projects, you will learn to give structured feedback as you build a visual vocabulary and deepen your understanding of fine art photography. - To inform your own practice, you are to give an artist presentation and to write an exhibition review. This will allow you to research, analyse and present findings on the work of established fine-art photographers and artists who are leading the use of digital imaging. - In-class technical assignments help entrench lessons learnt during lectures and demonstrations.",

    "module_description": "Most introductory courses or books in QM start off with special systems (for example infinite square well) and derive its wave function in position representation from the Schrodinger?s equation. Although this approach may be intuitive due to its physical setup, it tends to give the wrong impression that wave functions are fundamental objects in QM. In actual fact, wave functions are just the different representations of the state (ket in Dirac notation) of the system. One can always choose other representations or even not choose a representation. This course aims to unteach wave mechanics and free you of particular representations and work with the formalism directly. You will explore the logical development of Quantum Mechanics (QM) formalism and develop QM systematically from finite to infinite dimensions in three parts. Part 1 aims to give a complete and systematic run-down of basic quantum kinematics and quantum dynamics so that you have a working understanding of quantum mechanics for finite-dimensional and infinite dimensional systems. The concept of measurement will also be covered. This provides probabilistic results for experiments. Part 2 aims to discuss symmetry within QM. Rotational symmetry (angular momentum is the generator of rotations) is the main and very important example. The rotational symmetry in Hydrogenic atoms will also be discussed, which will also introduce you to 3D QM. Part 3 adds on to the formalism for systems that cannot be solved exactly. These are real-life QM examples and the standard method to solve these systems is via perturbation for time-independent/dependent and non-degenerate/degenerate systems."

    "module_description": "'The Asian Century' is the buzz word that many pundits and experts use in describing East Asia in the 21st Century. Given the rapid economic development in the region, propelled by China and the Southeast Asian states with the United States, Japan, and South Korea as the established economies, Asia has a great potential to lead the world economies. However, East Asia currently faces many security challenges, including strategic uncertainty about the rise of China and US commitment to the region; regional territorial disputes, such as East and South China Sea, the Northern Territories, Takeshima/Dokto, India-China border disputes; Japan?s historical controversies with China and South Korea; North Korea's nuclear and missile development; and the Taiwan political problem. Here, the important question is how to maintain regional stability and ensure the mid- and long-term security in East Asia to realize a true 'Asian Century.' This course provides the student in-depth knowledge about the security development in East Asia from the post-World War II period as well as theoretical perspectives to capture the main components of East Asian Security mechanism. We will discuss the concept of 'East Asia' and ?International Security; history of East Asian security; US 'hub-and-spoke' system, particularly the US-Japan alliance; ASEAN multilateralism, particularly ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting, and East Asia Summit; advanced theoretical frameworks to make sense of East Asian security; and regional security issues, such as the Rise of China, the Korean Peninsula, the Taiwan Straits, East and South China Sea. In order to foster discussions in the class, students need to catch up with contemporary East Asian affairs, through Newspaper, Magazines, and on-line media. By the end of this class, you should have a more nuanced understanding of security threats in East Asia and be able to use international relations theory to explain why certain issues become threats and how political actors have sought to resolve them."

    "Prerequisite:": "HA1002",
    "module_description": "This course will provide students with a theoretical interrogation of the concept of democracy, particularly as it relates to the issue of social division. Throughout the history of political thought, theorists from Plato to John Rawls have recognized that division is the essence of the sphere of politics: divisions continually emerge between different parts of the political community, between those who claim different titles to govern, those with differing desires and needs, those with opposing visions of the common good, and so on. With few exceptions, however, the tradition's canonical thinkers have seen this plurality as a condition that needs to be overcome, not as one to be affirmed. In this course we will study a variety of twentieth-century political theorists who have not only recognized the fact of human difference, but who argue that the realization of democracy depends upon precisely the affirmation of this difference. Democracy is thus essentially related to the effort to give an expression to the multiplicity of social forms of doing, being, and thinking that internally differentiate all political societies. Students will be encouraged to contrast this understanding of democracy with those contemporary ones that emphasize the values of social harmony and consensus, providing them with a ground to critically probe actually existing political institutions and orders."

By leading classes along with discussions, students are encouraged to marshal facts embedded in the public decision making, analyze research literature, critically examine the pros and cons, and support educated conclusion as potentially qualified public administrators and policymakers. This course provides students with basic principles of political economy and applies them to public administration issues on the interaction of the public and private sectors of our economy at an advanced level. In a broader manner, this course will cover the following questions: 1. What is the market failure? 2. When can government play a role in improving market outcomes? 3. How can we evaluate whether a policy is likely to be effective? 4. What are the potential pitfalls associated with government involvement in markets (bureaucratic failure)? 5. How can public managers improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their organizations?"

Cities are growing in size and in presence! Literature about cities and urbanism proliferates as new fads of urbanism ebb and flow. With the deluge of information about the woes and potentialities of cities for human futures, this course aims to take a reflective stance and ask as Lewis Mumford once did, 'What is a City?' with the goal to gain clarity about the concept, purpose and the nuts and bolts of a city as a human environment. This course draws upon selected readings in classic and modern philosophy about what a good city is. Even though these philosophical readings discussed cities in the classical and early modern times, they touched upon many dimensions and challenging issues of contemporary cities including size, class, inequality, diversity, justice and their relationship with the urban built environment. These topics are intended to form the content of the course for the subsequent weeks. Whenever available and appropriate, policy reports from international organizations like the United Nations will be included in the topical discussion throughout the semester to make explicit the nexus between theory and practice that lies at the crux of most urban research. The course content is deliberately multi-disciplinary, reflecting the rich and vast interest in the planning and development of cities. This course is for students who are keen to further engage in a critical inquiry of cities and discussing about what a good city is, beyond the basic content offered in HU1002: Introduction to Urban Planning and HU2002: Urban Life and Urban Planning. The course is crafted with the aim to allow students to co-produce and co-own the course content that they find valuable in informing their interests about the subject matter, and their graduation research projects."

The general goals of this course are to explore the nature, problems, challenges and potential of psychology testing. The first half of the course is devoted to the foundations of psychological testing in various contexts. As part of this we examine topics such as the historical roots of psychological testing, uses of psychological tests, ethical considerations, and technical and methodological principles involved in developing and evaluating test materials. The second section of the course surveys major types of psychological tests, such as intellectual ability, educational aptitude, personality and assessment in the workplace. By the end of the course students are expected to understand the basics of test theory and test construction, and be able to critically evaluate the tests that we consider in the course which are drawn from tests commonly used in the field of psychological testing"

The goal of this course is to provide the foundations to understand consumer insight - the desires and necessities that are on the surface of consumers' conscious thought and the deeper, possibly unconscious motives that drive human behavior at an implicit level. To achieve this goal, students will be exposed to a thorough understanding of the internal and external factors that influence consumer behaviour. Working in an area that is so critical to almost every business activity brings a high degree of excitement and a justifiable sense of importance."

It shows us that our lives are interconnected, but also that disparities between social groups can grow over time. In addition, we will briefly explore some methodological tools that can help us evaluate these processes. The class schedule is divided into three broad parts. In the first part of the course, we will learn about the key principles of the life course perspective and how they can be applied empirically. In the second part, we will explore different drivers of societal change over time, and learn to discriminate between them. Finally, in the third part, we will explore select topics that are crucial to life course analysis, such as the integration of biomarkers in life course research."

Part I, 'Millennial Sociological Theories,' interrogates how, in the late 20th century and recent years, various theorists have conceptualized the workings of culture, knowledge, social organization and governance in the state. Part II, 'Contemporary Conversations', surveys how more recent scholars and intellectual commentators are discussing problems in contemporary societies and societal transformations, particularly in the context of the fourth industrial revolution, the rise of identity politics, burgeoning online community formation, the eruption of podcast media, and moral panics in relation to gender identity and gender relations. By bringing the theories of previous decades to bear on contemporary concerns, students will gain an understanding of the contemporary relevance and practical utility of engaging with long-standing conversations in social theory."

There are several sociological perspectives on social psychology; we will focus primarily on symbolic interactionism. We will study a number of different aspects of social life, including perspective, reality, language and meaning, minds, selves and identities, interaction and social order, and broader conceptions of social behavior and relationships. The course should provide working answers to the following questions: 1. What is social psychology, from a sociological perspective? What is symbolic interactionism? Why are symbolic interactionists concerned with the psychology of people? 2. What methods do symbolic interactionists use to study the social world? 3. How do people construct an understanding of reality and the social world? 4. How do symbolic interactionists theorize the relationship between individuals and society? 5. How do symbolic interactionists explain social order, and in particular its negotiated qualities?"

Organizations in the pursuit of profit have been implicated in a number of scandals involving bribery & corruption, fraud, labour and human rights abuses, and environmental degradation. What role does law and ethics play in holding companies and individuals responsible for such scandals? How can companies ensure that they pay attention to social, environmental and governance factors and remain profitable? How do individuals and organizations decide what is the right thing to do? This course will require students to understand broad business sustainability issues and to apply ethical reasoning processes to decision making.",

    "module_description": "With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' is now central for organizational success. Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporation, employees, community, government, non-government and others. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to global. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this, yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large-, medium- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development of skills for dealing with complex problems in general."

The course considers how social entrepreneurship plays out in organizations ranging from conventional companies seeking to adopt corporate social responsibility practices to double-bottom-line businesses and social enterprises. The course specifies strategic and implementation tensions inherent in aligning business and social/environmental values, and provides frameworks with which to analyse and resolve the tensions at play.This course trains you into a quasi-expert of social entrepreneurship by enabling them to apply frameworks to making tough decisions in real business contexts. The course includes four modules: strategic corporate social responsibility (SCSR); double-bottom-line business (DBL), social enterprise (SE) and business ethics (BE). It begins by analysing and making decisions on the cases of conventional companies conducting social innovation initiatives through SCSR and DBL. We will then move to explore the cases of social enterprises. You will observe both the common and distinctive challenges facing conventional companies and social enterprises. The modules of SCSR, DBL and SE will be followed by an Entrepreneur Panel where social entrepreneurs introduce their initiatives and engage in a highly interactive conversation with students. The course will finish by taking a look at business ethics theories and issues that provide analytical depth and clarification to your understanding of social entrepreneurship.",

It is also relevant to us as consumers because we are exposed to hundreds of messages from marketers every day. The course is aimed at enabling students to learn in depth the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication (marcom) activities. The course provides students with relevant knowledge about how businesses interact or communicate with the market. In particular, because planning and executing marketing communication programs are typically the responsibilities of marketing executives, the course can help students to prepare for a job position that involves marketing communications. It can help them deepen their understanding of marketing - in particular, what marketing communications involve and how marketing communications enable an organisation to achieve its objectives. The course is designed to foster your logical thinking and creativity regarding marketing communications. Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts essential to your understanding of marketing communication (marcom) practices (e.g., how they work and their applicability). Learning these theories and concepts is also important because they facilitate you to choose and justify your choice and design of marcom activities. Instead of treating marcom as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities. The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing). The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and discusses how they can be integrated for achieving the marketer's objectives. While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances.",

We ask the questions: What is its nature? And, how does it work? The case for its reality and its rationally binding objectivity will be defended, then the main branches of ethical theories outlined. These include utilitarianism, Kantian duty ethics and the ideas of the virtue and natural law ethical tradition stemming from Aristotle and Aquinas. A brief overview of theories of justice (including those of Rawls, Nozick and Sen) will be made. And it is intended that these concepts will be critically applied to the interface between ethics and law and the market, and some of paradigmatic issues and situations in three areas which confront businesses and people in all fields of practical endeavour today, in a series of case studies under the headings: Profit, People, Planet. Intended Audience: It is a participation intensive course for students who welcome informed critical discussion based on required readings of extracts from the primary writings of the philosophers under study. These may include: corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (profit), employment equality and labour rights (people), and environmental sustainability (planet). Value: The course is intended to provide a breath of vision and understanding that will stand our students in good stead should they decide to pursue deeper studies in any particular area of ethics and as a basis for thinking their way around the concrete moral challenges of modern business and life."

We ask the questions: What is its nature? And, how does it work? The case for its reality and its rationally binding objectivity will be defended, then the main branches of ethical theories outlined. These include utilitarianism, Kantian duty ethics and the ideas of the virtue and natural law ethical tradition stemming from Aristotle and Aquinas. A brief overview of theories of justice (including those of Rawls, Nozick and Sen) will be made. And it is intended that these concepts will be critically applied to the interface between ethics and law and the market, and some of paradigmatic issues and situations in three areas which confront businesses and people in all fields of practical endeavour today, in a series of case studies under the headings: Profit, People, Planet. Intended Audience: It is a participation intensive course for students who welcome informed critical discussion based on required readings of extracts from the primary writings of the philosophers under study. These may include: corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (profit), employment equality and labour rights (people), and environmental sustainability (planet). Value: The course is intended to provide a breath of vision and understanding that will stand our students in good stead should they decide to pursue deeper studies in any particular area of ethics and as a basis for thinking their way around the concrete moral challenges of modern business and life."

    "module_units": "3.0",
    "dept_maintain": "BUS",
    "module_description": "Effective decision making is an essential skill everyone should have. Forward-looking corporations such as Barclays, Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, as well as governmental agencies in the United States and Singapore are now applying insights from the principles of behavioural decision science to guide the design of products and services and even policy. This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time? Overall, you will develop strategic awareness about the biases that could influence judgment and lead to suboptimal decisions.",

It integrates major components from CC0005 Healthy living and Wellbeing and adds additional philosophical analysis to the course material. As the title connotes, the main objective of this undergraduate course is to examine what constitutes living a good, healthy and flourishing life. According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment. Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing. The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. Each week you will explore additional philosophical questions related to well-being, happiness, the self, and the connection between mind and body. By the end of this course, you would have developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful undergraduate education."

In this course, we will focus on representations of science in the media, particularly in new media, emphasizing ideas of public perceptions of, engagement with, and discourse about science. This focus encompasses both accurate and inaccurate representations of science and draws linkages between science literacy and media literacy. In addition, we will consider the perspectives of the content creators, and what factors may influence their creative decisions. Finally, we will create our own science vlogs with the aim of engaging specific audiences."

We are experiencing a time where a spike in the discussion about alternative facts and fake news, as well as an increasing popularity of true crime documentaries and fiction that is based on true stories is effecting our sense of truth, ethics and aesthetics. Against the backdrop of this development, this seminar has the goal to look deeper into the ethics of image production in the dynamic field of art and journalism. The course spans the artistic spectrum, with an eye for the journalistic, examining historical (pre-photography) fine art, photojournalism, reportage (drawn journalism), podcasts and documentary film. This course is an interdisciplinary investigation into the popularity, ethics, and cultural effects of \"reporting\" in the broadest sense with a deep examination into the concept of truth in media."

Prominent speakers from various Food MNCs, local SMEs, and regulatory bodies (AVA and/or WHO) will be invited to present every week on various topics and food issues. This will also give the students a valuable opportunity to interact personally with food industries and have a deeper understanding of the food policies and issues around the world. This course is aimed to raise awareness among students about real world challenges in food industry around the world and in Singapore. Subjects such as food security, food sustainability and food waste management will be the main focus for every week's seminar. A convergence of factors has made food security one of the most important global issues. An increasing population wants a more varied diet, but is trying to grow more food on less land with limited access to water, all the time facing increased costs for fertiliser, and fuel for storage and transport. Even after food is grown, stored and transported, serious losses can occur, and in developing nations where `plentiful? food is wasted. A review of food waste in the US calculated that around 20% of the amount available to consume, was lost from retailing onwards. This translate to 20% of the land, water, labour, seed, pesticide and fertiliser are wasted in the process and thus this is also a financial and environmental loss too. In view of the growing world population and thus a growing demand in food, most of the food produced today is reflective of an unsustainable food system. This food is dependent on foreign oil, is destroying soil, contaminates water, has caused disease outbreaks, and may be robbing our future generations of the ability to grow food at all."

    "module_description": "Summary: Cryptography is the foundational building block of Cybersecurity and Privacy. While the field of classical cryptography dealt with security and privacy of data in transit, the modern take on the subject has generalized the scope of its applications to ensuring security and privacy of all forms of digital communication, computation, automation, interaction, transaction and preservation. Thus, it is important to understand the technical aspects of cryptography to appreciate its applications in cybersecurity. The Aim: This cryptography course in Computer Science and Engineering aims to develop your ability to understand how cryptographic algorithms work, to identify the problems associated with the application of cryptography in real-world scenarios, and explain the operation of various cryptographic mechanisms. This course will equip you to know deeply the fundamentals of symmetric key ciphers, hash functions and public key ciphers, enabling you to understand and develop secure cryptography solutions in real life cryptography. It will also introduce you to popular cryptographic libraries and APIs for hands-on implementation of security mechanisms, and some prominent cryptographic standards, guidelines and frameworks from the industry and government bodies."

Part II: The aim of this part is to show how you can obtain structural information on molecular compounds. We will begin with some general considerations in structural determination. This will be followed by more details on two very important techniques ? NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The former is a powerful method for studying molecules in solution and the latter for structures in the solid state. For the former, we will be looking at some concepts essential to an understanding of NMR spectroscopy, phenomena which can affect the appearance of an NMR spectrum, and some useful NMR techniques that can be used to study molecular structures and dynamics."

We will end the course with contemporary engagements with the idea of revolution by looking at some realist literature from Taiwan, documentary films from Hong Kong, and the suppressed articulations of dissent in mainland China. The themes of art and revolution provide a specific perspective to revisit modern Chinese literary history. They highlight the political urgencies behind the renovation of national culture in the beginning of the twentieth century, and reveal how such imperatives continued to shape the changing contour of Chinese literature and culture throughout this long century. The focus on art and revolution also allow us to look beyond revolution in its most straightforward political sense, and attend to the revolution of gender norms and cultural forms that were equally important in modern Chinese history. We will pay attention to this multifaceted idea of revolutionary in our textual analyses of literary and artistic works. The texts covered in this course ranges from literature, film, documentary, the visual arts, as well as theoretical and discursive documents. We will also address different genres of literature such as fiction, drama, and poetry."

Tectonic processes are fundamentally about motion: rocks move from one place to another as part of a rigid plate, or are squeezed like toothpaste in a collision zone, or erode from regions of uplift and are deposited as sediment in regions of subsidence, or rise toward the surface from regions of mantle melting. The integration of these motions over time has produced the highly complex crust of Earth that we observe today. This course will cover global-scale tectonic processes and systems, with a focus on active tectonic environments where rich observational data can be mined for a better understanding of processes. Students will develop fluency with tectonic elements and processes through readings of seminal papers, interactive lectures and in-class discussions, and computational laboratory exercises based on real-world data. Each student will adopt a different active tectonic region of Earth and will progressively develop a deep understanding of its origin, evolution, and tectonic environments, culminating in a final report and presentation."

The increasing global population, combined with rising incomes, means the world's environmental and natural resources are under significant pressure. Management of these environmental pressures in a way which ensures sustainability is now a priority in many environmental conventions and agreements. This course will provide in depth knowledge on techniques that can be used to quantify and value environmental resources, and the management strategies that can be implemented for different systems. An understanding of these processes is essential for Environmental Science majors who wish to work in consultancy positions, government bodies, NGOs or private companies in this field."

You should take this course, first, if you would like to learn why we study Genomes and Genomics, and why the field has been exponentially grown since the human genome project completed in 2010. Genomics and sequencing technology have driven various fields of science and significantly affected human life. Second, you should take this course if you would like to learn what is genetic differences between individuals and how it expresses as traits, disease symptoms, and responses to pathogens. Besides, you will learn about how Genomics can contribute to the identification and treatment of diseases by analyzing personal genomes. If you are interested in your future careers in public health, life science, medicine, insurance, risk assessment, and big data, this course should be helpful. You will learn how the technology of genome sequencing, has affected human social structure or system, for instance, marriage and pregnancy by obtaining person genome information. You will think about your identity by disclosing your genetic ancestry and how it affects society and politics sometimes. You will learn the current trend of that government actively generate population genome data along with medical records from their citizen. This is closely related to developing public health policy, medical facility, and system, insurance policy, storing and analyzing of the big data, which all effects economics. Ultimately, the accumulation of genome data will impact your life, especially for your lifetime health. By the end of this course, you will obtain knowledge and your own value on life technology, which something you cannot learn from textbooks. In addition, you should be able to predict how humans will evolve in near future in terms of genetics and society. The human genome will evolve in a unique way, not only under nature?s law but also by technology which can change genes or reduce risks. This can be essential knowledge for everyone during this pandemic. The course will have also shed a light on Asian populations which have been relatively understudied. You can learn about Asian population genomics directly from scientists who are currently conducting research for Asians."

Taking taxonomy as an overall theme, this course begins by delineating approaches to perception, articulation, and emotion that emerged during the long eighteenth century. Following this, we will examine seminal texts by William Wordsworth and Jane Austen before embarking on a series of thematic lectures on the city, education and children's books, and the pleasures and pains of opium. In order to reflect the diversity of print culture between 1740 and 1820, this course explores a variety of primary source material. Literary works, such as poetry and fiction, will be examined alongside pedagogical theory and discourses on elocution and aesthetics. Throughout the course, we will consider our own experience as readers of eighteenth-century and Romantic texts in relation to reading practice during the period. How did rising literacy rates and innovations in textual production and circulation influence literary form, genre, and taste?"

The central context of the dramatic changes lie in changes in modernization policy in Singapore - in the 1970s, from a 'pragmatic' and culturally philistine modernization that sought to homogenize/standardize culture and the cityscape in the name of economic development, to a 1990s- present modernization that (in contrast) desires Singapore to be a more hip 'global city for the arts' (a 1992 government-policy phrase). The changing contexts are as important as the texts to be examined. Why was the Singapore state not interested in what can be called 'high culture' or 'serious art' in the 1960s & 1970s? The emphasis then appeared to be on culture conceived of as 'racial' and ethnic culture - and such ethnic-cultural identities are effectively transformed by the urban change and state-led social engineering. What sort of literary and other cultural responses were there in relation to the state's policies on culture and racial management in the 1980s? What happened in the state's thinking on culture in the 1990s that led a (supposed move away from a philistinism) to a desire to invest in the arts? How did creative-cultural producers relate to these unexpected changes? Such will be the questions that this module will address."

It is not until the early twentieth century, according to Thompson, that machine-generated noises started to impinge upon the everyday lives of people. Called the 'Age of Noise,' the turn of twentieth century was filled with the sounds of auditory technologies (the microphone, radio, telephone, and phonograph), public transportation (the elevated train and subway), World War I, construction, factories, steam locomotives, industrial whistles and bells, machine shops, cash registers, washing machines, sewing machines, vacuum cleaners, typewriters, printing machines, automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles.

    "module_description": "This course allows students to take a more focused approach to Victorian literature and culture. By providing a thematic, rather than a chronological, introduction to a number of nineteenth-century literary texts, it aims to show that the shifts in literary representations at the time were part of an extremely versatile cultural scene that belies any retrospective typecasting of \"Victorianism.\" The comparison of canonical Victorian works and only recently reprinted material, primarily by long forgotten nineteenth-century women writers, will help us to understand the literary developments that engendered a plethora of controversies, both at the time and in its wake, brought out such a versatility of works, and perhaps above all, created the novel genre as the Victorian era's most popular, critical, and representative form of cultural expression."

These authors are alert to the strains of contemporary music, influenced by film and television, conscious of the prevalence of visual imagery in society and are keenly aware of the multi-racial/religious natures of their cities and towns. Contemporary British writers are deeply aware of international intellectual and artistic developments and the sheer variety of narrative approaches testify to the major contribution made by recent writers to the contemporary novel. Thus, it is possible to consider their work as representative of contemporary European society, while being conscious of profound threads of connection with the idea of the contemporary beyond the borders of Britain."

    "module_description": "Literature and Medicine seeks to present health as a contested term with a continually evolving set of principles and meanings. The nature, causes, and meaning of states of health and sickness is determined not only by physical symptoms but influenced by class, gender, and race, and is perceived differently by patients, practitioners, and policy-makers. Twentieth-century British authors such as Ian McEwan, A.S. Byatt, Ali Smith, James Kelman, David Lodge, and Will Self offer a cultural history of the present that is united by a particular concern with the myths and metaphors that contribute to our under-standing of health and sickness. Accordingly Literature and Medicine guides students through a series of literary texts that engage with contemporary issues of health and sickness and signal the inadequacy of any understanding of health that is not culturally, historically, and geographically situated. Literature and Medicine uncovers the ways in which twentieth-century British authors urge us to reclaim the narrative of the individual sick person and reconsider what it means to be healthy and what it means to be sick in the twenty-first century. Sociological readings on the history and philosophy of medicine that signal the inadequa-cy of any understanding of health that is not culturally, historically and geographically sit-uated. Novels concerned with the myths and metaphors that contribute to our understanding of health and sickness. Material from the emergent field of the medical humanities including anthropology and cultural studies, literature and applied linguistics, performing arts, visual art, and creative practices with a focus on healing and recovery. Supplementary material on approaches to delivering humanities into healthcare and the requirement for practice based evidence."

Encoun- ters with the uncarmy/unheimlich (unhomely) and the abject in these texts unveil deep- seated anxieties regarding race, gender, class, and power, and these are collated with the way that the gothic reconfigures or destabilizes identity, especially as it relates to larger notions of nationhood, history, and belonging. Texts may include Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger (2008), Raja Rao's Kanthapura (1938/1970), Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea, and Beth Yahp's The Crocodile Sea."

Each week we will examine one or more case studies, organised broadly into three literary genres or periods bearing different contextual relationships to representation and reality: the Romantic poem and essay, the realist novel, and postmodern narrative. In each case study, we will (1) evaluate whether the literary work meets our or other definitions of virtual reality, (2) analyse how the work generates its particular immersive effects, and (3) discuss the significance of immersive experience both to the work's specific aims and contexts, and to our modern understandings of virtuality."

Since then the field has expanded to other parts of the world including Africa, Europe, and Australia. The course introduces students to the history of archaeology defined by its focus on material culture, and how its development intersects with history, especially in the study of past cultures, societies and technologies of periods when historical documentation was also available. The course begins with a diachronic survey of the relations between history and archaeology before narrowing its focus to the specific development of historical archaeology in North America and its impact on other parts of the world, especially Asia. By examining case studies, images, and readings, the course helps students to acquire elementary skills to interpret the information presented in the course. Students will learn to identify and discuss key questions, approaches, methods, and sources used in historical archaeology at the end of the course."

Designed to encourage comparisons, we will interrogate how each tradition is defined, the characteristics and influences shaping practice of medicine, the connections between traditional medicine and the natural world, the emergence of hybrid practices such as Peranakan, and how traditional medicine supports, complements, and contests biomedicine in the modern state. This course is targeted for those who are keen to explore medicine beyond the scientific tradition and explore approaches that deprivilege biomedicine and institutions such as hospitals to delve into a past where healthcare was less institutionalized and regulated. It will be of value to humanities students who may be contemplating career paths in the health service (particularly in the burgeoning fields of alternative medicine) and to medical students who would like to integrate biomedical and traditional approaches to healing."

It aims to enlighten students on the origins and course of the conflict in the subregion in the global context. It also seeks to help students appreciate the cultural, diplomatic, economic, political, and social impacts of the twentieth century global conflict on Southeast Asia. In addition, the course will analyze the effect that the turn of events in the area had on global and international developments. To those ends, the course will pay particular attention to the multidimensional attempts by external powers to expand their influence in Southeast Asia as well as the ways that peoples within the area furthered their personal and national ends by exploiting, adapting to, and resisting the Cold War powers` involvement in their societies. By studying developments within twentieth century Southeast Asia from global, international, transnational, and national perspectives, therefore, we will discover that inasmuch as external forces had shaped the subregion, Southeast Asians had also made significant impacts on the course of global and international history."

    "Prerequisite:": "HH1001",
    "module_description": "The cultures of South Asia are among the most fetishized in the Western world, and few Indian concepts lend themselves to fetishization better than tantra. In popular culture, tantra is associated not only with images of transgressive sexuality, but also antinomian violence and a glamorization of death. When Western scholars in colonial India discovered tantra, they were horrified to find ritual manuals detailing how one may consume the flesh of corpses, channel the goddesses of the cremation ground, and recite spells to butcher one's enemies. This course begins with a critique of colonial misconceptions and then proceeds to examine tantra in its original South Asian contexts. The term tantra, which translates roughly to 'technology,' or 'technique,' rose to prominence in medieval South Asian culture during a moment of radical historical transformation (300?1200CE). In contrast to the modern image of the state-an orderly, unified, and bureaucratized entity, in which the work ethic of the nuclear family facilitates a highly regulated economy-medieval South Asia was essentially an anarchic space. These tantras emerged in the world of medieval South Asia as a set of techniques for coping with, and accruing power within, a political and social reality perceived to be dystopian, chaotic, and slouching toward decay. But, it was precisely because political unification was elusive that the Indian Subcontinent was fertile ground for radical innovation. In this course, we will examine the complex ecosystem of political, economic, religious, aesthetic, and philosophical institutions of tantric South Asia that challenged-and even reversed-classical Indian gender, familial, caste, religious, and ritual norms. The first section of the course discusses the cultural and literary building blocks of tantra articulated in archaic and classical Indian culture (1000BCE-300CE), including ritual literature, court poetry, and treatises on politics, erotic desire, and warfare. We will then examine the tantric culture of reversals of classical Indian norms during the medieval period (300-1200CE): the Tantric Age. Finally, we will consider the enduring legacies of tantra in South Asian culture in the last section of the course, Tantric Afterlives (1200CE-present)."

The course will provide the students with a general and accurate overview of the above-mentioned topics, associating notions of Language Documentation and Language Description with elements of Anthropological Linguistics, Philology, and Comparative Literature. The course examines the epistemological issue of orality, culture, and literacy both from the point of view of basic original and theoretical principles established by the best scholars in this discipline (from Milman Parry, to Albert Lord, to Eric Havelock, to Marcel Jousse, to John Foley, to Ruth Finnegan, to Edgard Sienaert), and from the point of view of the direct analysis of examples of oral `unwritten texts? and oral strategies in handing down the traditional knowledge. The teaching activity will be also substantiated by the application of general principles of Theoretical Linguistics and Comparative Literature. Particular attention will be given to the analysis of a number of methodological `milestones? in the study on orality, culture, and literacy, in particular to The Anthropology of Gesture by Marcel Jousse and to works by Milman Parry, Eric Havelock, Albert Lord, and Ruth Finnegan. The course will introduce, therefore, the study of orality, language, and literature in a historical and theoretical way, not only analyzing the related general issues, but also dealing with the direct application of basic principles in reading and interpreting `unwritten texts? of oral traditions from all over the world."

The goal of this course is to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand, evaluate, and design and implement a wide range of speech synthesis and recognition systems. These two fields are highly relevant in the linguistics-related sector of the information and communications technology industry. Taking this course will open up opportunities for you by preparing you to enter positions related to these topics or pursue advanced degrees dealing with speech synthesis and/or recognition. For those of you who are more interested in linguistics research, the course will have positive benefits for the study phonetics and phonology, since many of the topics discussed reinforce and extend issues in these fields, particularly concerning acoustic phonetics."

    "module_description": "This course is organized into two closely related modules. Module 1 introduces what is Systems Thinking and how does it relate to Systems Engineering. Systems Thinking is a dialectical way of thinking that relates real-world needs and problems to idealized conceptual models in order to explore and develop viable solutions. A systemic approach is adopted that emphasizes both logic and culture, as in human behaviour, in problem solving. It recognises that the world is a set of highly interconnected technical and social entities which are hierarchically organised producing emergent properties. Systems Thinking is an essential skill for Systems Engineers which is shared with many disciplines and provides a key intellectual underpinning for Systems Engineering and program management. Module 2 provides first a conceptual-level description of Systems Engineering discipline. It then follows up with application aspects of the systems engineering processes and practices that relate to the life cycle development and management of an engineered system. The course aims to provide an overview of how a quality engineered system is developed based broadly on an extended life-cycle model from defining a business case, addressing stakeholders? needs and requirements, developing systems requirements, functional and physical architecture, to systems design and build, systems integration and verification, and final validation and acceptance. This course also gives emphasis to the interdependency between Systems Engineering and Program Management, with both disciplines enabled by Systems Thinking and methodologies. Teaching cases will be used to illustrate the economic, technical and programmatic benefits of applying systems thinking and systems engineering practices in the planning, development and deployment of complex products and systems. A special topic will be introduced to gain an appreciation of the strategy and architecture of Industry 4.0. A system of systems perspective will be encouraged to gain additional insights of this 4th Industrial Revolution and how it will shape the future of manufacturing.",

    "module_description": "As a sports coach helps an athlete develop and excel at a sport, a health coach helps a person or team to excel at living healthy life to the full, taking the best. This course will equip you with foundations of health coaching - skills useful for life wherever it takes you - whether you will be the next CEO, a full-time dad or mom, an entrepreneur or a cool government employee. It comprises a series of modules covering highly engaging topics on health coaching with a focus on sleep as a superpower. This is the first course in a stackable learning series that would equip you ultimately as a super health coach. The course consists of 13 three-hour sessions (two sessions of 3 hours per week) comprising of blended and highly interactive learning activities, conducted in the first six weeks of Semester 1 AY2021-22. The last session will be an assessment session held in the sixth week. In addition, this same course will also be run in the last six weeks of Semester 1 AY2021-22, and an assessment session to be held in the sixth week. These sessions will cover the following seven themes: 1. Being cool! Being super-woman and -man (introduction to health coaching) 2. Who cares about sleep? Superpower. (sleep) 3. This is so tasty! (nutrition) 4. Sweat the good stuff (exercise) 5. Why? Why? It's driving me crazy! (mental wellbeing) 6. Is it gonna harm me? (addictions) 7. Relationships matter! (healthy relationships) The modules cover the topic of sleep, but also important areas that affect sleep such as nutrition, exercise, mental wellbeing, addictions, and healthy relationships. These modules will be offered in a `flipped classroom model' where students self-study materials and subsequently have discussions and practical interactive sessions. The students will practice coaching skills which will be assessed in a role-based assessment with simulated roles. The cutting-edge role of digital health supporting the coach and the person will be interwoven in every module. Finally, we Singaporeans are one of the most sleep deprived people. Some might even be proud about regularly not sleeping enough. However, this comes at a high price for wellbeing and health. Utilizing the superpower of sleep has a wide range of proven health benefits including a lower chance of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, and not least making one feel better! Recognizing that one can be cool whilst living healthy and shunning away from unhealthy lifestyle habits and applying early preventive measures to improve health is possible and is focus of this course. An important strategy to facilitate healthy lifestyle choices and promote health is through health coaching. Health coaching has been applied and shown to be effective in the prevention and management of chronic diseases and supporting lifestyle choices in healthy individuals. It is crucial to equip students with healthy lifestyle skills and knowledge and, specifically, on coaching techniques to create awareness about the importance of lifestyle choices. It will allow students to be equipped with essential skills to become health coaches and to take the role of health ambassadors later in their life. Moreover, health coaching can provide new career opportunities, with employment in healthcare expected to increase enormously in the coming years. This course will be the first in a series of courses on health coaching, with the current course having a focus on sleep. Sleep is crucial for health and wellbeing, and it is known that many students do not get enough sleep However, sleep deprivation is linked to lower cognitive and academic performance, lower productivity, obesity, depression, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, and numerous other health risk factors. Exercise, nutrition, and mental wellbeing all have an important influence on a healthy sleep pattern. A `stackable learning approach' is planned in which students will be able to `stack' certificates that will eventually lead to a professional diploma as health coach."

    "module_description": "Most introductory courses or books in QM start off with special systems (for example infinite square well) and derive its wave function in position representation from the Schrodinger?s equation. Although this approach may be intuitive due to its physical setup, it tends to give the wrong impression that wave functions are fundamental objects in QM. In actual fact, wave functions are just the different representations of the state (ket in Dirac notation) of the system. One can always choose other representations or even not choose a representation. This course aims to unteach wave mechanics and free you of particular representations and work with the formalism directly. You will explore the logical development of Quantum Mechanics (QM) formalism and develop QM systematically from finite to infinite dimensions in three parts. Part 1 aims to give a complete and systematic run-down of basic quantum kinematics and quantum dynamics so that you have a working understanding of quantum mechanics for finite-dimensional and infinite dimensional systems. The concept of measurement will also be covered. This provides probabilistic results for experiments. Part 2 aims to discuss symmetry within QM. Rotational symmetry (angular momentum is the generator of rotations) is the main and very important example. The rotational symmetry in Hydrogenic atoms will also be discussed, which will also introduce you to 3D QM. Part 3 adds on to the formalism for systems that cannot be solved exactly. These are real-life QM examples and the standard method to solve these systems is via perturbation for time-independent/dependent and non-degenerate/degenerate systems."

Given the rapid economic development in the region, propelled by China and the Southeast Asian states with the United States, Japan, and South Korea as the established economies, Asia has a great potential to lead the world economies. However, East Asia currently faces many security challenges, including strategic uncertainty about the rise of China and US commitment to the region; regional territorial disputes, such as East and South China Sea, the Northern Territories, Takeshima/Dokto, India-China border disputes; Japan?s historical controversies with China and South Korea; North Korea's nuclear and missile development; and the Taiwan political problem. Here, the important question is how to maintain regional stability and ensure the mid- and long-term security in East Asia to realize a true 'Asian Century.' This course provides the student in-depth knowledge about the security development in East Asia from the post-World War II period as well as theoretical perspectives to capture the main components of East Asian Security mechanism. We will discuss the concept of 'East Asia' and ?International Security; history of East Asian security; US 'hub-and-spoke' system, particularly the US-Japan alliance; ASEAN multilateralism, particularly ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting, and East Asia Summit; advanced theoretical frameworks to make sense of East Asian security; and regional security issues, such as the Rise of China, the Korean Peninsula, the Taiwan Straits, East and South China Sea. In order to foster discussions in the class, students need to catch up with contemporary East Asian affairs, through Newspaper, Magazines, and on-line media. By the end of this class, you should have a more nuanced understanding of security threats in East Asia and be able to use international relations theory to explain why certain issues become threats and how political actors have sought to resolve them."

With these knowledge, students will gain an ability to analyze the ASEAN?s utility (potentials and limitations) and raison d'etre by employing not only International Relations (IR) theories, but also theories in other fields (e.g. psychology, sociology, history). Those who are interested in graduate studies in International Relations and Asian/Southeast Asian studies or career in foreign affairs and international relations should take this course, since this becomes a rigid intellectual foundation of ASEAN studies."

    "Prerequisite:": "HA1002",
    "module_description": "This course will provide students with a theoretical interrogation of the concept of democracy, particularly as it relates to the issue of social division. Throughout the history of political thought, theorists from Plato to John Rawls have recognized that division is the essence of the sphere of politics: divisions continually emerge between different parts of the political community, between those who claim different titles to govern, those with differing desires and needs, those with opposing visions of the common good, and so on. With few exceptions, however, the tradition's canonical thinkers have seen this plurality as a condition that needs to be overcome, not as one to be affirmed. In this course we will study a variety of twentieth-century political theorists who have not only recognized the fact of human difference, but who argue that the realization of democracy depends upon precisely the affirmation of this difference. Democracy is thus essentially related to the effort to give an expression to the multiplicity of social forms of doing, being, and thinking that internally differentiate all political societies. Students will be encouraged to contrast this understanding of democracy with those contemporary ones that emphasize the values of social harmony and consensus, providing them with a ground to critically probe actually existing political institutions and orders."

Based on diverse theoretical and practical perspectives, students are able to learn various market and bureaucratic scenarios including micro- and macro-economic problems and impacts and how tools of modern political economy can be used to address contemporary policy questions. By leading classes along with discussions, students are encouraged to marshal facts embedded in the public decision making, analyze research literature, critically examine the pros and cons, and support educated conclusion as potentially qualified public administrators and policymakers. This course provides students with basic principles of political economy and applies them to public administration issues on the interaction of the public and private sectors of our economy at an advanced level. In a broader manner, this course will cover the following questions: 1. What is the market failure? 2. When can government play a role in improving market outcomes? 3. How can we evaluate whether a policy is likely to be effective? 4. What are the potential pitfalls associated with government involvement in markets (bureaucratic failure)? 5. How can public managers improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their organizations?"

Cities are growing in size and in presence! Literature about cities and urbanism proliferates as new fads of urbanism ebb and flow. With the deluge of information about the woes and potentialities of cities for human futures, this course aims to take a reflective stance and ask as Lewis Mumford once did, 'What is a City?' with the goal to gain clarity about the concept, purpose and the nuts and bolts of a city as a human environment. This course draws upon selected readings in classic and modern philosophy about what a good city is. Even though these philosophical readings discussed cities in the classical and early modern times, they touched upon many dimensions and challenging issues of contemporary cities including size, class, inequality, diversity, justice and their relationship with the urban built environment. These topics are intended to form the content of the course for the subsequent weeks. Whenever available and appropriate, policy reports from international organizations like the United Nations will be included in the topical discussion throughout the semester to make explicit the nexus between theory and practice that lies at the crux of most urban research. The course content is deliberately multi-disciplinary, reflecting the rich and vast interest in the planning and development of cities. This course is for students who are keen to further engage in a critical inquiry of cities and discussing about what a good city is, beyond the basic content offered in HU1002: Introduction to Urban Planning and HU2002: Urban Life and Urban Planning. The course is crafted with the aim to allow students to co-produce and co-own the course content that they find valuable in informing their interests about the subject matter, and their graduation research projects."

This class will introduce you to the Whorfian Hypothesis about the relationship between language and thought, and how to conduct experimental tests using the neo-Whorfian approach and techniques from psycholinguistics. In the first half of the class, you will take part in a number of quick-fire experiments, to build up an experimental `tool kit' of techniques. We will review current evidence about the influence of different linguistic features on different domains of cognition and perception (e.g., categorization, spatial cognition, numerical cognition, colour perception, audition, and cross-modal perception). For each domain, we will investigate how the published literature relates to language in Singapore, and identify gaps in the existing literature. Interactions between language and the mind in extreme scenarios (e.g., language deprivation) will also be addressed. In the second half of the course, you will identify a research gap, formulate detailed a hypothesis, preregister a study, and conduct a data collection exercise for presentation in the class Symposium - a poster session held in the final week of term. The lab-based class provides an in-depth experience of the research cycle from identification of knowledge gaps to hypothesis formation, data collection and research presentation, with a focus on 21st century research skills such as power analysis & preregistration. This class will provide valuable insights for students with an interest in cross-cultural differences, psycholinguistics, education, or philosophy of mind. Students planning on conducting psychological research in the future will benefit from hands on experience of current best practice in the research cycle."

This course will benefit you if you have an interest in working with the police, prisons, military security, probations, child protection, the courts and community forensic psychology as a psychologist, counsellor, case manager or a law enforcer or safety officer. The slant of this course will be towards forensic-law enforcement, rather than forensic-clinical or forensic-mental health issues. This means that the focus on crime-mental health issues will be limited, and there will be a focus on law enforcement and crime prevention, investigation, crime profiling and analysis. This course will provide you with a realistic preview of the work of a psychologist working in applied forensic law enforcement contexts, because there will be a field visit and a talk by a law enforcement professional. Actual Singaporean and international case studies will be presented. Projects will be based on real-world problems and solutions that will also require practical considerations (e.g. budgeting, planning, and so on in addition to crime prevention factors). For those intending to become professional law enforcers (e.g. police or prisons officers), this course will provide you with the theoretical and conceptual foundations relating to crime analysis and crime prevention."

This course provides an interdisciplinary overview of the major psycho-socio-cultural perspectives, theories and clinical practices on death and dying from a global viewpoint with a critical focus on the Asian experience. Through interactive lectures, experiential workshops and creative group projects, students will be offered an opportunity to examine the psychological, socio-spiritual, ethical and political issues of mortality through a range of cultural lenses. Such exploration will facilitate insights, reflections and personal growth for enhancing students' capacity in dealing with the inevitability of morality, while equipping them with the core intellectual skills and values for living a meaningful and purposeful life."

This course examines theories and types of organisations, especially in terms of hierarchy, control, authority, decision -making and accountability. In particular, it considers the rise and impact of bureaucracy and bureaucratic rationality in modern society and the subsequent development of schools or systems of management. In understanding the formal features of bureaucratic and post -bureaucratic organizations, the course also considers the informal, cultural and small -group processes that influence the functioning of organisations. Organisational change and the transformation of management in contemporary society is analysed in terms of the relations between organisations and their environments."

    "module_description": "This course is an introduction to the life course approach, and how it is applied to social science. With the help of several concepts and principles, the life course perspective helps us understand how societies and individuals change over time. It gives us a framework to examine various factors (e.g., historical, social) that affect us as we grow older; both in the continuities of life, and in the twists/turns that may happen to us along the way. It shows us that our lives are interconnected, but also that disparities between social groups can grow over time. In addition, we will briefly explore some methodological tools that can help us evaluate these processes. The class schedule is divided into three broad parts. In the first part of the course, we will learn about the key principles of the life course perspective and how they can be applied empirically. In the second part, we will explore different drivers of societal change over time, and learn to discriminate between them. Finally, in the third part, we will explore select topics that are crucial to life course analysis, such as the integration of biomarkers in life course research."

Beginning with a discussion of the significance of changing demographic patterns within nation-states and in the global context, we consider the development of population science and major theories of demographic change. Special attention is given to 'the demographic transition' and the causes and consequences of population growth in developed and developing countries. In understanding population dynamics, we focus on basic aspects of demographic structure and composition and analyze their implications for ethnic, gender, class and inter-generational relations. Population growth and distribution are also studied in relation to fecundity and fertility, morbidity and mortality, and migration."

The course goal is to help students interrogate social and cultural phenomena in contemporary societies. After taking this course, students should be able to reflect on - and ask better questions about - the workings of culture, society, and individual and collective identities in the broader world and in their own lives. The course is organized into two broad themes. Part I, 'Millennial Sociological Theories,' interrogates how, in the late 20th century and recent years, various theorists have conceptualized the workings of culture, knowledge, social organization and governance in the state. Part II, 'Contemporary Conversations', surveys how more recent scholars and intellectual commentators are discussing problems in contemporary societies and societal transformations, particularly in the context of the fourth industrial revolution, the rise of identity politics, burgeoning online community formation, the eruption of podcast media, and moral panics in relation to gender identity and gender relations. By bringing the theories of previous decades to bear on contemporary concerns, students will gain an understanding of the contemporary relevance and practical utility of engaging with long-standing conversations in social theory."

That conventional approach assumes that all societies advance through linear, evolutionary stages of 'progress' through the adoption of modernizing institutions and practices. In studying the historical experience of developing countries (in Africa, Latin America and Asia), this subject views development and social change through the lens of political, economic and cultural processes, recognizing that outcomes of 'development' often hinge on competing ideas, conflicting interests, and power asymmetries. Students will gain a historically grounded understanding of development and social change in a variety of institutional settings."

Likewise, science fiction as a genre often deals with the same themes, though through imaginative content, including futuristic or alternative settings, science and technology. It is simultaneously critical and innovative in its focus on lived reality. Its imaginative elements are largely plausible within current scientific paradigms, and genre writers often explore the potential consequences of social, scientific, and technological changes in society. Content 1. The relationship between human imagination and social theory 2. The social constructionism of reality 3. Literary conceptualizations and representations of self and other 4. Social stratification, including sexuality, gender, race/species, and class 5. Political economic and cultural analyses of production and consumption 6. The politics of everyday life (utopias and dystopias) 7. Current issues in science, technology, and society"

In addition to exploring key issues in urban studies through the frame of the global city, the course also aims to introduce methodological perspectives for studying how global city processes manifest at the scale of the everyday. In doing so, this course takes the `urban? as the primary unit of analysis, as opposed to the `national? or `state?. The first part of the course introduces and discusses the main critiques of conceptualisations of Global Cities, after which examples of Global Cities from the `North? and `South? are discussed in greater detail. The course goes on to present methodological perspectives for doing research in such urban spaces. The second half of the course delves into important urban concerns around liveability, sustainability and the economy, amongst others, approached from the perspective of the Global City. As far as possible, discussions and the selection of readings will attempt a balance between cities of the global `North? and `South?, with a particular focus on Asia."

We will draw upon case studies from Singapore and around the world to provide empirical contexts to the concepts discussed in lectures. Through the interdisciplinary lens of human geography, these contextual examples will reflect the diverse place-based practices, processes, problems and possibilities of life in contemporary societies."

As the world becomes increasingly urbanized and our ecosystem becomes more fragile, the need for proper management of urban land through sensible land use planning has become ever more critical. In this course, we will learn about the important processes that shape our urban past, present and futures, including urbanization and the historical development of cities. These processes form an epistemic context upon which the study of urban planning will be introduced. We will discuss about the relevance of urban planning as part of urban governance, including its scope of practice, the agencies and institutions involved in the planning process in different cities, and in Singapore."

Students will gain an understanding of the historical and contemporary challenges of global inequality with reference to specific case studies. We shall be discussing what Development means by examining different development pathways and strategies throughout the global economy. While the course's main premise is economic development, we shall be reading more widely across the literature which strategically ties development to different scales -bodies, villages, cities, nations, across borders - to show that development is really not limited to the Global South but is vitally about (dis)connections and (im)mobilities in the global economy. This will also show that development is not disembodied but made up of and affects different people in very different ways. Case studies from around the world are used to provide empirical contexts to the theories we learn about international development practices, processes and problems."
