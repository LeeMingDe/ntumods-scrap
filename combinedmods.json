Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication. While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts.

According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment. Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing. The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships.

Its deceptively simple core theme of \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' is now central for organizational success. Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporation, employees, community, government, non-government and others. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to global. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this, yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large-, medium- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts.

The course considers how social entrepreneurship plays out in organizations ranging from conventional companies seeking to adopt corporate social responsibility practices to double-bottom-line businesses and social enterprises. The course specifies strategic and implementation tensions inherent in aligning business and social/environmental values, and provides frameworks with which to analyse and resolve the tensions at play.This course trains you into a quasi-expert of social entrepreneurship by enabling them to apply frameworks to making tough decisions in real business contexts. The course includes four modules: strategic corporate social responsibility (SCSR); double-bottom-line business (DBL), social enterprise (SE) and business ethics (BE). It begins by analysing and making decisions on the cases of conventional companies conducting social innovation initiatives through SCSR and DBL.

You will have access to Nikon DSLR cameras; software such as Photoshop and Adobe Bridge; and Epson Inkjet printers. What Makes a Good Photograph? An investigation into the elements of a good photograph. Exploring within a single image, the basic concepts of framing, composition, lighting, colour and subject engagement. Through analysis of each other?s prints, you will learn about the importance of colour management and its effect on tonality and colour characteristics. Differences and similarities between Straight Photography and Conceptual Photography will be discussed. Developing a Photographic Series: An in-depth exploration of strategies to develop a photographic series. Different artists and genres of photography will be introduced to help you articulate your own photographic interests. Project development will be guided along through the stages of researching references, planning, execution and review. You will also learn to apply basic concepts of curation with the editing, selection and presentation of images. The Role of the Photographer: Through analysis and discussions of a variety of images, you will be introduced to the semiotics of photography and the role of the photographer in its creation. The photographer as director/art director takes on the responsibility of meaning-making within the frame. Awareness will be brought to the ideas of the preconditioned gaze and the definition of the self in opposition to the other. This will translate to working with subjects and how best to engage and represent them in a photograph. Photography in the Digital Age of Social Media: Digital technology has made the photographic image more ubiquitous than ever. Lectures and discussions will touch upon photographic history and theory, as we try to locate the position of photography as an art form in the age of social media and the proliferation of the everyday image. Attempts will be made as a class to define distinguishing or overlapping traits between fine art and vernacular photography. Class Assignments: - Three creative projects of increasing difficulty help guide you along the process of developing a conceptual photography series. These projects are developed through lectures, tutorials, and instructor and peer feedback sessions. During guided group critiques of projects, you will learn to give structured feedback as you build a visual vocabulary and deepen your understanding of fine art photography. - To inform your own practice, you are to give an artist presentation and to write an exhibition review. This will allow you to research, analyse and present findings on the work of established fine-art photographers and artists who are leading the use of digital imaging. - In-class technical assignments help entrench lessons learnt during lectures and demonstrations.", "Not available to all Programme with: ": " Yr1", "Not available as BDE/UE to Programme: ": "ADM(MA)", "prerequisiteFor": "DP3000, DP3010", "exam": "Not Applicable", "schedule": ["MON", "TUE", "WED", "FRI"], "timetable": {"63055": [{"day": "MON", "details": "DP2001 TUT G01 ART-02-26 1330to1620- Wk2-13;"}], "64026": [{"day": "TUE", "details": "DP2001 TUT G02 ART-02-26 1330to1620- Wk2-13;"}], "64027": [{"day": "WED", "details": "DP2001 TUT G03 ART-02-26 1630to1920- Wk2-13;"}], "64028": [{"day": "FRI", "details": "DP2001 TUT G04 ART-02-26 1330to1620- Wk2-13;"}]}, "isLabBased": false, "isOnline": false, "workload": {"lecture": 0, "tutorial": 3.0, "lab": 0}}, "DP2002": {"course_name": "Minor in Art History 2021 1", "module_code": "DP2002", "module_name": "HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY", "module_units": "3.0", "dept_maintain": "ADM", "module_description": "This open elective course will provide an overview of the evolution of the photographic medium over two hundred years from earliest invention to contemporary innovations.

It includes a number of characteristics, such as breaking a problem into small and repetitive ordered steps, logically ordering and analyzing data and creating solutions that can be effectively implemented as algorithms running on computer. As such, CT is essential not only to the Computer Science discipline, but also can be used to support problem solving across all disciplines, including math, science, engineering, business, finance and humanities. The aim of this course is hence to take you students with no prior experience of thinking in a computational manner to a point where you can derive simple algorithms and code programs to solve some basic problems in your domain of studies. You will also learn current computer languages, such as Python, for the coding. In addition, the course will include topics on the internal operations of a processor, and raise awareness on the socio-ethical issues arising from the pervasiveness of computing technology.", "Mutually exclusive with: ": "BG2211, BS1009, CE1003, CE1103, CH2107, CV1014, CZ1003, CZ1103, EE1005, FE1008, MS1008, PS0001", "Not available to Programme: ": "ACBS, ACC, ADM, ARED, BCE, BCG, BEEC, BIE, BMS, BS, BSB, BSPY, BUS, CBE, CBEC, CE, CEE, CEEC, CHEM, CHIN, CNEL, CNLM, CS, CSC, CSEC, CVEC, DSAI, ECMA, ECON, ECPP, ECPS, EEE, EEEC, EESS, ELAH, ELH, ELHS, ELPL, ENE, ENEC, ENG(CEE), ENG(EEE), ENG(ENE), ENG(NULL), ESPP, HIST, HSCN, HSLM, IEEC, IEM, LMEL, LMPL, LMS, MACS, MAEC, MAEO, MAT, MATH, MS(ITG), MS(NULL), MS-2ndMaj/Spec(MSB), MTEC, PHIL, PHY, PLCN, PLHS, PPGA, PSLM, PSMA, PSY, REP, SCED, SOC, SSM", "prerequisiteFor": "MA0218, EE0005", "exam": "Not Applicable", "schedule": ["MON", "WED", "THU", "FRI"], "timetable": {"23097": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA1 N3.2-01-34 1030to1220- Wk2-13;"}], "23098": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA2 N3.2-01-34 1030to1220- Wk2-13;"}], "23099": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "WED", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA3 N3.2-01-34 1030to1220- Wk2-13;"}], "23100": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "WED", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA4 N3.2-01-34 1030to1220- Wk2-13;"}], "23101": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "THU", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA5 N3.2-01-34 1530to1720- Wk2-13;"}], "23102": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "THU", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA6 N3.2-01-34 1030to1220- Wk2-13;"}], "23103": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "THU", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA7 N3.2-01-34 1030to1220- Wk2-13;"}], "23104": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "THU", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA8 N3.2-01-34 1030to1220- Wk2-13;"}], "23105": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "THU", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA9 N3.2-01-34 1330to1520- Wk2-13;"}], "23106": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "THU", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA10 N3.2-01-34 1330to1520- Wk2-13;"}], "23107": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "THU", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA11 N3.2-01-34 1330to1520- Wk2-13;"}], "23108": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "THU", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA12 N3.2-01-34 1530to1720- Wk2-13;"}], "23109": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "THU", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA13 N3.2-01-34 1530to1720- Wk2-13;"}], "23110": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "FRI", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA14 N3.2-01-34 0830to1020- Wk2-13;"}], "23111": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "FRI", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA15 N3.2-01-34 0830to1020- Wk2-13;"}], "23112": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "FRI", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA16 N3.2-01-34 0830to1020- Wk2-13;"}], "23113": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "FRI", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA17 N3.2-01-34 1030to1220- Wk2-13;"}], "23114": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "FRI", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA18 N3.2-01-34 1030to1220- Wk2-13;"}], "23115": [{"day": "MON", "details": "MA1008 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0830to0920;"}, {"day": "FRI", "details": "MA1008 TUT MA19 N3.2-01-34 1030to1220- Wk2-13;"}]}, "isLabBased": false, "isOnline": true, "workload": {"lecture": 1.0, "tutorial": 2.0, "lab": 0}}, "MA2001": {"course_name": "2021 1 Aerospace Engineering Year 1", "module_code": "MA2001", "module_name": "MECHANICS OF MATERIALS", "module_units": "3.0 AU", "module_description": "The first four topics of the text are devoted to the analysis of the stresses and of the corresponding deformations in various structural members, considering successively axial loading, torsion, and pure bending.

The study of each type of loading is complemented by a large number of examples designed to strengthen the students' understanding of the subject. Topic 5 is devoted to the determination of shearing stresses in beams under transverse loadings. More advanced aspects of the design of beams, such as the determination of the principal stresses at the junction of the flange and web of a W-beam, are in Topic 6. The chapter also includes the determination of stresses under combined loadings that can now include the determination of the principal stresses, principal planes, and maximum shearing stress at a given point. The determination of the deflection of beams is discussed in Topic 7. The first part of the chapter is devoted to the integration method followed by the use of singularity functions.

We will review current evidence about the influence of different linguistic features on different domains of cognition and perception (e.g., categorization, spatial cognition, numerical cognition, colour perception, audition, and cross-modal perception). For each domain, we will investigate how the published literature relates to language in Singapore, and identify gaps in the existing literature. Interactions between language and the mind in extreme scenarios (e.g., language deprivation) will also be addressed. In the second half of the course, you will identify a research gap, formulate detailed a hypothesis, preregister a study, and conduct a data collection exercise for presentation in the class Symposium - a poster session held in the final week of term.

This course is aimed to raise awareness among students about real world challenges in food industry around the world and in Singapore. Subjects such as food security, food sustainability and food waste management will be the main focus for every week's seminar. A convergence of factors has made food security one of the most important global issues. An increasing population wants a more varied diet, but is trying to grow more food on less land with limited access to water, all the time facing increased costs for fertiliser, and fuel for storage and transport. Even after food is grown, stored and transported, serious losses can occur, and in developing nations where `plentiful? food is wasted. A review of food waste in the US calculated that around 20% of the amount available to consume, was lost from retailing onwards. This translate to 20% of the land, water, labour, seed, pesticide and fertiliser are wasted in the process and thus this is also a financial and environmental loss too. In view of the growing world population and thus a growing demand in food, most of the food produced today is reflective of an unsustainable food system. This food is dependent on foreign oil, is destroying soil, contaminates water, has caused disease outbreaks, and may be robbing our future generations of the ability to grow food at all.", "exam": "Not Applicable", "schedule": ["FRI"], "timetable": {"55213": [{"day": "FRI", "details": "CH9221 LEC/STU LE ONLINE 0930to1220- Wk1,2; CH9221 LEC/STU LE CBE-LT 0930to1220- Wk3-13;"}]}, "isLabBased": false, "isOnline": true, "workload": {"lecture": 3.0, "tutorial": 0, "lab": 0}}, "CH9222": {"course_name": "Broadening and Deepening Electives/Unrestricted Electives in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering 2021 1", "module_code": "CH9222", "module_name": "FUTURE FOODS - INTRODUCTION TO ADVANCED MEAT ALTERNATIVES", "module_units": "3.0", "dept_maintain": "CBE", "Prerequisite:": "Study Year 3 or 4", "module_description": "The course aims to equip you with knowledge of the rapidly growing and innovative field of alternative proteins which is developing advanced replacements for traditional meat products.

The changing contexts are as important as the texts to be examined. Why was the Singapore state not interested in what can be called 'high culture' or 'serious art' in the 1960s & 1970s? The emphasis then appeared to be on culture conceived of as 'racial' and ethnic culture - and such ethnic-cultural identities are effectively transformed by the urban change and state-led social engineering.

Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will include an analysis of the Bollywood film Lagaan, and will introduce students to a number of important theoretical concepts in the field of postcolonial studies.", "exam": "26-Nov-2021 0900to1130 hrs", "schedule": ["FRI"], "timetable": {"17230": [{"day": "FRI", "details": "HL2022 SEM SEM1 HSSSEMRM9 0830to1120- Wk2-13; HL2022 SEM SEM1 HSSAUDIT 0830to1120- Wk1;"}]}, "isLabBased": false, "isOnline": false, "workload": {"lecture": 3.0, "tutorial": 0, "lab": 0}}, "HL2041": {"course_name": "Minor in English Literature 2021 1", "module_code": "HL2041", "module_name": "ASIAN HISTORICAL FICTION", "module_units": "3.0", "dept_maintain": "ELH(SOH)", "Prerequisite:": "HL1001", "module_description": "You will be introduced to fictional adaptations of historical events in this course which will encourage you to think about narrative concepts in fictional works, and the connections between 'fact' and 'fiction.'

These products may exhibit varied levels of complexity, spanning from being raw and derived data, intelligence and services derived from or driven by data, enabled by algorithmic and statistical tools such as machine learning. In many data products, the role of data can be subtle and the overall product may be composed of other modules, which could be more prominent in appearance. The scope of this course is confined to the exploration of the life-cycle of typical data products that deploy data-science dominantly or exclusively. We will deconstruct individual components across the full stack: ranging from data acquisition, wrangling and storage, testing, validation, and refinement - spanning exploratory analysis, issues of visualization and presentation, and application of machine learning techniques for decision support, anomaly detection and recommendation systems. We will explore this course with hands-on examples, illustrating how some data products utilize only a subset of these components, while others deploy the wider gamut. This course will also expose techniques to handle various kinds of data on their own and in conjunction, e.g., natural language data, datetime and timeseries, geoseries and graph data; the underlying systems and algorithms to support, analyze and learn using such data to build data products. Overall, in this course, we will describe several fundamental principles, and we will illustrate them in action using hands-on examples and tools. The choice of algorithms and software packages will be representative but not exhaustive. As such, the detailed description of course content uses 'e.g.,' to give possible indicative instances, but the actual delivery of the course may choose other tools, programming languages, frameworks and examples (including or excluding the indicative instances). Furthermore, the instantiation of tools and examples could vary over time, based on practical considerations, e.g., maturity and popularity of the tools among practitioners.

Game theory, besides being of fundamental mathematical interest, is a main tool to model economic and strategic situations and then study the behavior of rational agents in such situations. Mechanism design is the study of how to design games (such as auctions) so that agents have incentive to act in a desirable way, e.g. by telling the truth. This course will improve your ability to model and analyze economics situations in a mathematical way. We will study the way rational agents will play games, based on their assumptions about the rationality of other agents. We will learn about the concept of Nash equilibria, which are solutions to games that no rational agent has an incentive to deviate from, and learn how to compute these. In the second part of the course we turn to the problem of social choice, namely choosing from a set of alternatives, given the preferences of a set of players. We will see that many desirable properties of social choice functions cannot be satisfied, and then turn to ways to deal with this issue. The first way is to introduce payments and money-valued preferences, which leads to auction theory and related topics. Here students will learn how to design auctions and other economic mechanisms so that players have no incentive to lie, and to learn how to compute expected revenues. Secondly, we will consider mechanisms that do not allow payments, and study the ways manipulations by the players can be limited in this case. In the second part of the course students will learn how to design economic mechanisms that have certain properties (if possible), and how to judge economic mechanisms, as well as to apply Bayesian reasoning to compute expected outcomes.

Throughout the history of political thought, theorists from Plato to John Rawls have recognized that division is the essence of the sphere of politics: divisions continually emerge between different parts of the political community, between those who claim different titles to govern, those with differing desires and needs, those with opposing visions of the common good, and so on. With few exceptions, however, the tradition's canonical thinkers have seen this plurality as a condition that needs to be overcome, not as one to be affirmed. In this course we will study a variety of twentieth-century political theorists who have not only recognized the fact of human difference, but who argue that the realization of democracy depends upon precisely the affirmation of this difference. Democracy is thus essentially related to the effort to give an expression to the multiplicity of social forms of doing, being, and thinking that internally differentiate all political societies. Students will be encouraged to contrast this understanding of democracy with those contemporary ones that emphasize the values of social harmony and consensus, providing them with a ground to critically probe actually existing political institutions and orders.", "exam": "Not Applicable", "schedule": ["MON"], "timetable": {"20136": [{"day": "MON", "details": "HA4013 SEM SEM1 ONLIN 1430to1820- Wk1,2; HA4013 SEM SEM1 LHS-TR+31 1430to1820- Wk3-13;"}]}, "isLabBased": false, "isOnline": false, "workload": {"lecture": 4.0, "tutorial": 0, "lab": 0}}, "HA4017": {"course_name": "Minor in Public Policy And Global Affairs 2021 1", "module_code": "HA4017", "module_name": "ECONOMIC ISSUES FOR PUBLIC DECISION MAKING", "module_units": "4.0", "dept_maintain": "PPGA(SSS)", "Prerequisite:": "HA1003", "module_description": "This course introduces students to an in-depth examination of the forces that influence the behavior of public administrators engaged in the public sector decision-making process on economic issues.

This course draws upon selected readings in classic and modern philosophy about what a good city is. Even though these philosophical readings discussed cities in the classical and early modern times, they touched upon many dimensions and challenging issues of contemporary cities including size, class, inequality, diversity, justice and their relationship with the urban built environment. These topics are intended to form the content of the course for the subsequent weeks.

In popular culture, tantra is associated not only with images of transgressive sexuality, but also antinomian violence and a glamorization of death. When Western scholars in colonial India discovered tantra, they were horrified to find ritual manuals detailing how one may consume the flesh of corpses, channel the goddesses of the cremation ground, and recite spells to butcher one's enemies. This course begins with a critique of colonial misconceptions and then proceeds to examine tantra in its original South Asian contexts. The term tantra, which translates roughly to 'technology,' or 'technique,' rose to prominence in medieval South Asian culture during a moment of radical historical transformation (300?1200CE). In contrast to the modern image of the state-an orderly, unified, and bureaucratized entity, in which the work ethic of the nuclear family facilitates a highly regulated economy-medieval South Asia was essentially an anarchic space. These tantras emerged in the world of medieval South Asia as a set of techniques for coping with, and accruing power within, a political and social reality perceived to be dystopian, chaotic, and slouching toward decay. But, it was precisely because political unification was elusive that the Indian Subcontinent was fertile ground for radical innovation. In this course, we will examine the complex ecosystem of political, economic, religious, aesthetic, and philosophical institutions of tantric South Asia that challenged-and even reversed-classical Indian gender, familial, caste, religious, and ritual norms. The first section of the course discusses the cultural and literary building blocks of tantra articulated in archaic and classical Indian culture (1000BCE-300CE), including ritual literature, court poetry, and treatises on politics, erotic desire, and warfare. We will then examine the tantric culture of reversals of classical Indian norms during the medieval period (300-1200CE): the Tantric Age. Finally, we will consider the enduring legacies of tantra in South Asian culture in the last section of the course, Tantric Afterlives (1200CE-present).", "exam": "Not Applicable", "schedule": ["MON"], "timetable": {"17632": [{"day": "MON", "details": "HH4028 SEM SEM1 ONLINE 1030to1420- Wk1; HH4028 SEM SEM1 LHS-TR+51 1030to1420- Wk2-13;"}]}, "isLabBased": false, "isOnline": true, "workload": {"lecture": 4.0, "tutorial": 0, "lab": 0}}, "HH4090": {"course_name": "Minor in History 2021 1", "module_code": "HH4090", "module_name": "SPECIAL TOPICS IN HISTORY- GLOBAL ASIA", "module_units": "4.0", "dept_maintain": "HIST(SOH)", "module_description": "In the special topics in History of Global Asa, you will examine the Social history in the 20th century.

It is intended for you to develop a practical and systematic approach to controlling noise and vibration. Many noise problems relative to machines, buildings, etc., are in fact vibration problems; and the vibration problem must be solved before the noise problem can be eliminated. Besides covering the basic concepts of understanding vibration, analyzing vibration, and predicting the behavior of vibrating systems, the main emphasis is intended to provide the skills needed for designing vibrating systems with desired properties that enhance vibration when it is wanted and reduce vibration when it is unwanted.

In actual fact, wave functions are just the different representations of the state (ket in Dirac notation) of the system. One can always choose other representations or even not choose a representation. This course aims to unteach wave mechanics and free you of particular representations and work with the formalism directly. You will explore the logical development of Quantum Mechanics (QM) formalism and develop QM systematically from finite to infinite dimensions in three parts. Part 1 aims to give a complete and systematic run-down of basic quantum kinematics and quantum dynamics so that you have a working understanding of quantum mechanics for finite-dimensional and infinite dimensional systems. The concept of measurement will also be covered. This provides probabilistic results for experiments. Part 2 aims to discuss symmetry within QM. Rotational symmetry (angular momentum is the generator of rotations) is the main and very important example. The rotational symmetry in Hydrogenic atoms will also be discussed, which will also introduce you to 3D QM. Part 3 adds on to the formalism for systems that cannot be solved exactly.

The course is aimed at enabling students to learn in depth the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication (marcom) activities. The course provides students with relevant knowledge about how businesses interact or communicate with the market. In particular, because planning and executing marketing communication programs are typically the responsibilities of marketing executives, the course can help students to prepare for a job position that involves marketing communications.

The course is designed to foster your logical thinking and creativity regarding marketing communications. Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts essential to your understanding of marketing communication (marcom) practices (e.g., how they work and their applicability). Learning these theories and concepts is also important because they facilitate you to choose and justify your choice and design of marcom activities. Instead of treating marcom as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities. The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing). The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and discusses how they can be integrated for achieving the marketer's objectives.

This course will equip you with foundations of health coaching - skills useful for life wherever it takes you - whether you will be the next CEO, a full-time dad or mom, an entrepreneur or a cool government employee. It comprises a series of modules covering highly engaging topics on health coaching with a focus on sleep as a superpower. This is the first course in a stackable learning series that would equip you ultimately as a super health coach. The course consists of 13 three-hour sessions (two sessions of 3 hours per week) comprising of blended and highly interactive learning activities, conducted in the first six weeks of Semester 1 AY2021-22. The last session will be an assessment session held in the sixth week. In addition, this same course will also be run in the last six weeks of Semester 1 AY2021-22, and an assessment session to be held in the sixth week. These sessions will cover the following seven themes: 1. Being cool! Being super-woman and -man (introduction to health coaching) 2. Who cares about sleep? Superpower. (sleep) 3. This is so tasty! (nutrition) 4. Sweat the good stuff (exercise) 5. Why? Why? It's driving me crazy! (mental wellbeing) 6. Is it gonna harm me? (addictions) 7. Relationships matter! (healthy relationships) The modules cover the topic of sleep, but also important areas that affect sleep such as nutrition, exercise, mental wellbeing, addictions, and healthy relationships. These modules will be offered in a `flipped classroom model' where students self-study materials and subsequently have discussions and practical interactive sessions. The students will practice coaching skills which will be assessed in a role-based assessment with simulated roles. The cutting-edge role of digital health supporting the coach and the person will be interwoven in every module. Finally, we Singaporeans are one of the most sleep deprived people. Some might even be proud about regularly not sleeping enough. However, this comes at a high price for wellbeing and health. Utilizing the superpower of sleep has a wide range of proven health benefits including a lower chance of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, and not least making one feel better! Recognizing that one can be cool whilst living healthy and shunning away from unhealthy lifestyle habits and applying early preventive measures to improve health is possible and is focus of this course. An important strategy to facilitate healthy lifestyle choices and promote health is through health coaching. Health coaching has been applied and shown to be effective in the prevention and management of chronic diseases and supporting lifestyle choices in healthy individuals. It is crucial to equip students with healthy lifestyle skills and knowledge and, specifically, on coaching techniques to create awareness about the importance of lifestyle choices. It will allow students to be equipped with essential skills to become health coaches and to take the role of health ambassadors later in their life. Moreover, health coaching can provide new career opportunities, with employment in healthcare expected to increase enormously in the coming years. This course will be the first in a series of courses on health coaching, with the current course having a focus on sleep. Sleep is crucial for health and wellbeing, and it is known that many students do not get enough sleep However, sleep deprivation is linked to lower cognitive and academic performance, lower productivity, obesity, depression, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, and numerous other health risk factors. Exercise, nutrition, and mental wellbeing all have an important influence on a healthy sleep pattern.

In order to be equipped with the essential knowledge and skills to design effective environments, they will learn how to consider the needs of diverse children (individual and group), the relevance of the learning contexts, the use of age-appropriate and open-ended resources, issues of safety (physical and psychological), and the interlocking roles of the teacher as the environmental designer and as the facilitator of the learning in the setting up of the environment. To highlight the importance of exploration and play-based learning, and authentic experiences for preschool or lower primary children, the employment of learning centres will be extensively explored as an important pedagogical approach for teachers in the preschool or lower primary specialization. A key idea here is that the learning environment can support children as the protagonists of their construction of knowledge and foster respectful relationships. The course will therefore provide participants with an understanding of the principles and roles of learning centers and how these can be thoughtfully integrated within the preschool or lower primary curriculum and class setups (indoor and outdoor).

THE SCIENCE OF DECISION MAKING", "module_units": "3.0", "dept_maintain": "BUS", "module_description": "Effective decision making is an essential skill everyone should have. Forward-looking corporations such as Barclays, Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, as well as governmental agencies in the United States and Singapore are now applying insights from the principles of behavioural decision science to guide the design of products and services and even policy. This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time? Overall, you will develop strategic awareness about the biases that could influence judgment and lead to suboptimal decisions.", "Not available to all Programme with: ": " Yr1", "exam": "Not Applicable", "schedule": [], "timetable": {}, "isLabBased": false, "isOnline": false, "workload": {"lecture": 0, "tutorial": 0, "lab": 0}}, "HI8002": {"course_name": "General Education in Liberal Arts 2021  1", "module_code": "HI8002", "module_name": "SUSTAINABILITY: BIG ISSUES", "module_units": "3.0", "dept_maintain": "SOH", "module_description": "This course is a UE and GER-PE designed by students for students and catered to undergraduate students with an interest in sustainable development and environmental issues.

As the title connotes, the main objective of this undergraduate course is to examine what constitutes living a good, healthy and flourishing life. According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment. Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing.

Systems Thinking is a dialectical way of thinking that relates real-world needs and problems to idealized conceptual models in order to explore and develop viable solutions. A systemic approach is adopted that emphasizes both logic and culture, as in human behaviour, in problem solving. It recognises that the world is a set of highly interconnected technical and social entities which are hierarchically organised producing emergent properties. Systems Thinking is an essential skill for Systems Engineers which is shared with many disciplines and provides a key intellectual underpinning for Systems Engineering and program management. Module 2 provides first a conceptual-level description of Systems Engineering discipline. It then follows up with application aspects of the systems engineering processes and practices that relate to the life cycle development and management of an engineered system. The course aims to provide an overview of how a quality engineered system is developed based broadly on an extended life-cycle model from defining a business case, addressing stakeholders? needs and requirements, developing systems requirements, functional and physical architecture, to systems design and build, systems integration and verification, and final validation and acceptance. This course also gives emphasis to the interdependency between Systems Engineering and Program Management, with both disciplines enabled by Systems Thinking and methodologies. Teaching cases will be used to illustrate the economic, technical and programmatic benefits of applying systems thinking and systems engineering practices in the planning, development and deployment of complex products and systems. A special topic will be introduced to gain an appreciation of the strategy and architecture of Industry 4.0. A system of systems perspective will be encouraged to gain additional insights of this 4th Industrial Revolution and how it will shape the future of manufacturing.", "Not available to Programme: ": "ACBS, ACC, ACDA, ADM, ARED, BCE, BCG, BEEC, BIE, BMS, BS, BSB, BSPY, BUS, CBE, CBEC, CE, CEE, CEEC, CHEM, CHIN, CNEL, CNLM, CS, CSC, CSEC, CVEC, DSAI, ECDS, ECMA, ECON, ECPP, ECPS, EEE, EEEC, EESS, ELAH, ELH, ELHS, ELPL, ENE, ENEC, ENG, ESPP, HIST, HSCN, HSLM, IEEC, IEM, LMEL, LMPL, LMS, MACS, MAEC, MAEO, MAT, MATH, MS, MS-2ndMaj/Spec(MSB), MTEC, PHIL, PHMS, PHY, PLCN, PLHS, PPGA, PSLM, PSMA, PSY, REP, SCED, SOC, SSM", "Not available to all Programme with: ": " Yr1, (Admyr 2021-2021)-Non Direct Entry", "exam": "01-Dec-2021 1300to1500 hrs", "schedule": ["FRI"], "timetable": {"23493": [{"day": "FRI", "details": "MA9004 LEC/STU LE LT6 1330to1620- Wk3-13; MA9004 LEC/STU LE LT6 1330to1620- Wk1,2;"}]}, "isLabBased": false, "isOnline": false, "workload": {"lecture": 3.0, "tutorial": 0, "lab": 0}}, "MA9005": {"course_name": "Broadening and Deepening Electives/Unrestricted Electives in Mechanical Engineering 2021 1", "module_code": "MA9005", "module_name": "START UP: GETTING FROM ZERO TO MILLIONS", "module_units": "3.0", "dept_maintain": "ME", "module_description": "This course will introduce you to practical real-world conditions of venture building.
